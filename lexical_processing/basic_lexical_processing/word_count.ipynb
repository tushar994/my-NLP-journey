      "To Sherlock Holmes she is always _the_ woman. I have seldom heard him\r\n",
      "mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and\r\n",
      "predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion\r\n",
      "akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly,\r\n",
      "were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He\r\n",
      "was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that\r\n",
      "the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a\r\n",
      "false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe\r\n",
      "and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observerâexcellent for\r\n",
      "drawing the veil from menâs motives and actions. But for the trained\r\n",
      "reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely\r\n",
      "adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might\r\n",
      "throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive\r\n",
      "instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not\r\n",
      "be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And\r\n",
      "yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene\r\n",
      "Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away\r\n",
      "from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred\r\n",
      "interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master\r\n",
      "of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention,\r\n",
      "while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian\r\n",
      "soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old\r\n",
      "books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition,\r\n",
      "the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen\r\n",
      "nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime,\r\n",
      "and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of\r\n",
      "observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those\r\n",
      "mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police.\r\n",
      "From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his\r\n",
      "summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up\r\n",
      "of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and\r\n",
      "finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and\r\n",
      "successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of\r\n",
      "his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of\r\n",
      "the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One nightâit was on the twentieth of March, 1888âI was returning from a\r\n",
      "journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when\r\n",
      "my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered\r\n",
      "door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and\r\n",
      "with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a\r\n",
      "keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his\r\n",
      "extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I\r\n",
      "looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette\r\n",
      "against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his\r\n",
      "head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who\r\n",
      "knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own\r\n",
      "story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created\r\n",
      "dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell\r\n",
      "and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think,\r\n",
      "to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved\r\n",
      "me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a\r\n",
      "spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire\r\n",
      "and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWedlock suits you,â he remarked. âI think, Watson, that you have put\r\n",
      "on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âSeven!â I answered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIndeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I\r\n",
      "fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me\r\n",
      "that you intended to go into harness.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThen, how do you know?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting\r\n",
      "yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless\r\n",
      "servant girl?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âMy dear Holmes,â said I, âthis is too much. You would certainly have\r\n",
      "been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a\r\n",
      "country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I\r\n",
      "have changed my clothes I canât imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary\r\n",
      "Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there,\r\n",
      "again, I fail to see how you work it out.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIt is simplicity itself,â said he; âmy eyes tell me that on the inside\r\n",
      "of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is\r\n",
      "scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by\r\n",
      "someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in\r\n",
      "order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double\r\n",
      "deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a\r\n",
      "particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As\r\n",
      "to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of\r\n",
      "iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right\r\n",
      "forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where\r\n",
      "he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not\r\n",
      "pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his\r\n",
      "process of deduction. âWhen I hear you give your reasons,â I remarked,\r\n",
      "âthe thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I\r\n",
      "could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your\r\n",
      "reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I\r\n",
      "believe that my eyes are as good as yours.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âQuite so,â he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself\r\n",
      "down into an armchair. âYou see, but you do not observe. The\r\n",
      "distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps\r\n",
      "which lead up from the hall to this room.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âFrequently.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHow often?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWell, some hundreds of times.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThen how many are there?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHow many? I donât know.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âQuite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just\r\n",
      "my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have\r\n",
      "both seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these\r\n",
      "little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two\r\n",
      "of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.â He threw\r\n",
      "over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open\r\n",
      "upon the table. âIt came by the last post,â said he. âRead it aloud.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The note was undated, and without either signature or address.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThere will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight oâclock,â it\r\n",
      "said, âa gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very\r\n",
      "deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of\r\n",
      "Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with\r\n",
      "matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.\r\n",
      "This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your\r\n",
      "chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor\r\n",
      "wear a mask.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThis is indeed a mystery,â I remarked. âWhat do you imagine that it\r\n",
      "means?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has\r\n",
      "data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of\r\n",
      "theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from\r\n",
      "it?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was\r\n",
      "written.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThe man who wrote it was presumably well to do,â I remarked,\r\n",
      "endeavouring to imitate my companionâs processes. âSuch paper could not\r\n",
      "be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and\r\n",
      "stiff.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âPeculiarâthat is the very word,â said Holmes. âIt is not an English\r\n",
      "paper at all. Hold it up to the light.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I did so, and saw a large âEâ with a small âg,â a âP,â and a large âGâ\r\n",
      "with a small âtâ woven into the texture of the paper.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhat do you make of that?â asked Holmes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThe name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNot at all. The âGâ with the small âtâ stands for âGesellschaft,â\r\n",
      "which is the German for âCompany.â It is a customary contraction like\r\n",
      "our âCo.â âP,â of course, stands for âPapier.â Now for the âEg.â Let us\r\n",
      "glance at our Continental Gazetteer.â He took down a heavy brown volume\r\n",
      "from his shelves. âEglow, Eglonitzâhere we are, Egria. It is in a\r\n",
      "German-speaking countryâin Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. âRemarkable\r\n",
      "as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous\r\n",
      "glass-factories and paper-mills.â Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of\r\n",
      "that?â His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud\r\n",
      "from his cigarette.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThe paper was made in Bohemia,â I said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âPrecisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the\r\n",
      "peculiar construction of the sentenceââThis account of you we have from\r\n",
      "all quarters received.â A Frenchman or Russian could not have written\r\n",
      "that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only\r\n",
      "remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who\r\n",
      "writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his\r\n",
      "face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our\r\n",
      "doubts.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horsesâ hoofs and grating\r\n",
      "wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes\r\n",
      "whistled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âA pair, by the sound,â said he. âYes,â he continued, glancing out of\r\n",
      "the window. âA nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred\r\n",
      "and fifty guineas apiece. Thereâs money in this case, Watson, if there\r\n",
      "is nothing else.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI think that I had better go, Holmes.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNot a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell.\r\n",
      "And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âBut your clientââ\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNever mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes.\r\n",
      "Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the\r\n",
      "passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and\r\n",
      "authoritative tap.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âCome in!â said Holmes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches\r\n",
      "in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich\r\n",
      "with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad\r\n",
      "taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and\r\n",
      "fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was\r\n",
      "thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and\r\n",
      "secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming\r\n",
      "beryl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were\r\n",
      "trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of\r\n",
      "barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He\r\n",
      "carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper\r\n",
      "part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard\r\n",
      "mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand\r\n",
      "was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face\r\n",
      "he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip,\r\n",
      "and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length\r\n",
      "of obstinacy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYou had my note?â he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly\r\n",
      "marked German accent. âI told you that I would call.â He looked from\r\n",
      "one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âPray take a seat,â said Holmes. âThis is my friend and colleague, Dr.\r\n",
      "Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom\r\n",
      "have I the honour to address?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYou may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I\r\n",
      "understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and\r\n",
      "discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme\r\n",
      "importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you\r\n",
      "alone.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into\r\n",
      "my chair. âIt is both, or none,â said he. âYou may say before this\r\n",
      "gentleman anything which you may say to me.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. âThen I must begin,â said he,\r\n",
      "âby binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of\r\n",
      "that time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too\r\n",

      "âYou will excuse this mask,â continued our strange visitor. âThe august\r\n",

      "âThe circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to\r\n",
      "be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and\r\n",
      "seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak\r\n",
      "plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary\r\n",
      "kings of Bohemia.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI was also aware of that,â murmured Holmes, settling himself down in\r\n",
      "his armchair and closing his eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid,\r\n",
      "lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the\r\n",
      "most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes\r\n",
      "slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIf your Majesty would condescend to state your case,â he remarked, âI\r\n",
      "should be better able to advise you.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in\r\n",
      "uncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore\r\n",
      "the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. âYou are right,â\r\n",
      "he cried; âI am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhy, indeed?â murmured Holmes. âYour Majesty had not spoken before I\r\n",
      "was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von\r\n",
      "Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of\r\n",
      "Bohemia.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âBut you can understand,â said our strange visitor, sitting down once\r\n",
      "more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, âyou can\r\n",
      "understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own\r\n",
      "person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to\r\n",
      "an agent without putting myself in his power. I have come _incognito_\r\n",
      "from Prague for the purpose of consulting you.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThen, pray consult,â said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThe facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy\r\n",
      "visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress,\r\n",
      "Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âKindly look her up in my index, Doctor,â murmured Holmes without\r\n",
      "opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing\r\n",
      "all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to\r\n",
      "name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish\r\n",
      "information. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between\r\n",
      "that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a\r\n",

      "vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes\r\n",
      "tweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands into his\r\n",

      "heartily for some minutes.\r\n",

      "the road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room on\r\n",
      "the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor,\r\n",

      "open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window\r\n",
      "could be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it and\r\n",

      "Serpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives\r\n",
      "out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom\r\n",
      "goes out at other times, except when she sings. Has only one male\r\n",
      "visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and dashing,\r\n",

      "his friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had probably\r\n",

      "likely. On the issue of this question depended whether I should\r\n",
      "continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the\r\n",
      "gentlemanâs chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point, and it\r\n",
      "widened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these\r\n",

      "She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what\r\n",
      "indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a\r\n",
      "business man. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within\r\n",

      "the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the\r\n",
      "scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was\r\n",

      "down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one\r\n",
      "direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of better\r\n",
      "dressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it,\r\n",
      "crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene\r\n",
      "Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she\r\n",

      "rough one, too. Ah, heâs breathing now.â\r\n",

      "Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the\r\n",
      "principal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by\r\n",
      "the window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn,\r\n",
      "so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know\r\n",
      "whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he\r\n",
      "was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of\r\n",
      "myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I\r\n",
      "was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon\r\n",
      "the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes\r\n",
      "to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me. I hardened\r\n",
      "my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. After all, I\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who\r\n",
      "is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At\r\n",
      "the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my\r\n",
      "rocket into the room with a cry of âFire!â The word was no sooner out\r\n",
      "of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and\r\n",
      "illâgentlemen, ostlers, and servant maidsâjoined in a general shriek of\r\n",
      "âFire!â Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the\r\n",
      "open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later\r\n",
      "the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false\r\n",
      "alarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner\r\n",
      "of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friendâs arm\r\n",
      "in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly\r\n",
      "and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the\r\n",
      "quiet streets which lead towards the Edgeware Road.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYou did it very nicely, Doctor,â he remarked. âNothing could have been\r\n",

      "âI do not wish to make a mystery,â said he, laughing. âThe matter was\r\n",
      "perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was\r\n",
      "an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI guessed as much.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I\r\n",
      "suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to\r\n",
      "see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were\r\n",
      "compelled to open the window, and you had your chance.â\r\n",

      "her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It\r\n",
      "is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken\r\n",
      "advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it\r\n",
      "was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married\r\n",
      "woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box.\r\n",
      "Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house\r\n",
      "more precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to\r\n",
      "secure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting\r\n",
      "were enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The\r\n",
      "photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right\r\n",
      "bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as\r\n",
      "she half drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she\r\n",
      "replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have\r\n",
      "not seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the\r\n",
      "house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once;\r\n",
      "but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it\r\n",
      "seemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all.â\r\n",

      "ââNot so many as you might think,â he answered. âYou see it is really\r\n",

      "not many who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint. When I saw how\r\n",

      "matter, after all. However, when our turn came the little man was much\r\n",
      "more favourable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door\r\n",

      "âBecause he was handy and would come cheap.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAt half wages, in fact.â\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âSmall, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. âI thought as\r\n",
      "much,â said he. âHave you ever observed that his ears are pierced for\r\n",
      "earrings?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a\r\n",
      "lad.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHum!â said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. âHe is still with\r\n",
      "you?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âOh, yes, sir; I have only just left him.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAnd has your business been attended to in your absence?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNothing to complain of, sir. Thereâs never very much to do of a\r\n",
      "morning.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThat will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon\r\n",
      "the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I\r\n",
      "hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWell, Watson,â said Holmes when our visitor had left us, âwhat do you\r\n",
      "make of it all?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI make nothing of it,â I answered frankly. âIt is a most mysterious\r\n",
      "business.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAs a rule,â said Holmes, âthe more bizarre a thing is the less\r\n",
      "mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes\r\n",
      "which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most\r\n",
      "difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhat are you going to do, then?â I asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âTo smoke,â he answered. âIt is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg\r\n",
      "that you wonât speak to me for fifty minutes.â He curled himself up in\r\n",
      "his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and\r\n",
      "there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out\r\n",
      "like the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that\r\n",
      "he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly\r\n",
      "sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his\r\n",
      "mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âSarasate plays at the St. Jamesâs Hall this afternoon,â he remarked.\r\n",

      "hours?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very absorbing.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThen put on your hat and come. I am going through the City first, and\r\n",
      "we can have some lunch on the way. I observe that there is a good deal\r\n",
      "of German music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than\r\n",
      "Italian or French. It is introspective, and I want to introspect. Come\r\n",
      "along!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk\r\n",
      "took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we\r\n",
      "had listened to in the morning. It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel\r\n",
      "place, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out\r\n",
      "into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few\r\n",
      "clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden\r\n",
      "and uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown board with\r\n",
      "âJABEZ WILSONâ in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the\r\n",
      "place where our red-headed client carried on his business. Sherlock\r\n",
      "Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it\r\n",
      "all over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. Then he\r\n",
      "walked slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still\r\n",
      "looking keenly at the houses. Finally he returned to the pawnbrokerâs,\r\n",
      "and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or\r\n",
      "three times, he went up to the door and knocked. It was instantly\r\n",
      "opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to\r\n",
      "step in.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThank you,â said Holmes, âI only wished to ask you how you would go\r\n",
      "from here to the Strand.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThird right, fourth left,â answered the assistant promptly, closing\r\n",
      "the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âSmart fellow, that,â observed Holmes as we walked away. âHe is, in my\r\n",
      "judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not\r\n",
      "sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known something of him\r\n",
      "before.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âEvidently,â said I, âMr. Wilsonâs assistant counts for a good deal in\r\n",
      "this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you inquired your\r\n",
      "way merely in order that you might see him.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNot him.â\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from\r\n",
      "the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as\r\n",
      "the front of a picture does to the back. It was one of the main\r\n",
      "arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City to the north and west.\r\n",
      "The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in\r\n",
      "a double tide inward and outward, while the footpaths were black with\r\n",
      "the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was difficult to realise as we\r\n",
      "looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that\r\n",
      "they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant\r\n",
      "square which we had just quitted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âLet me see,â said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing along\r\n",
      "the line, âI should like just to remember the order of the houses here.\r\n",
      "It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London. There is\r\n",
      "Mortimerâs, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg\r\n",
      "branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and\r\n",
      "McFarlaneâs carriage-building depot. That carries us right on to the\r\n",
      "other block. And now, Doctor, weâve done our work, so itâs time we had\r\n",
      "some play. A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land,\r\n",
      "where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no\r\n",
      "red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very\r\n",
      "capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the\r\n",
      "afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness,\r\n",
      "gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his\r\n",
      "gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those\r\n",
      "of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted,\r\n",
      "ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. In his\r\n",
      "singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his\r\n",
      "extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often thought,\r\n",
      "the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which\r\n",
      "occasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from\r\n",
      "extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never\r\n",
      "so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in\r\n",
      "his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions.\r\n",
      "Then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him,\r\n",
      "and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of\r\n",
      "intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would\r\n",
      "look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other\r\n",
      "mortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St.\r\n",
      "Jamesâs Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom\r\n",
      "he had set himself to hunt down.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYou want to go home, no doubt, Doctor,â he remarked as we emerged.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes, it would be as well.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAnd I have some business to do which will take some hours. This\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âWhy serious?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âA considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to\r\n",
      "believe that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being Saturday\r\n",
      "rather complicates matters. I shall want your help to-night.â\r\n",

      "âAt what time?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âVery well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger, so\r\n",
      "kindly put your army revolver in your pocket.â He waved his hand,\r\n",
      "turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was always\r\n",
      "oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock\r\n",
      "Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had\r\n",
      "seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not\r\n",
      "only what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the\r\n",
      "whole business was still confused and grotesque. As I drove home to my\r\n",
      "house in Kensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary story\r\n",
      "of the red-headed copier of the _EncyclopÃ¦dia_ down to the visit to\r\n",
      "Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from\r\n",
      "me. What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed?\r\n",
      "Where were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from Holmes\r\n",
      "that this smooth-faced pawnbrokerâs assistant was a formidable manâa\r\n",
      "man who might play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it\r\n",
      "up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an\r\n",
      "explanation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my way\r\n",
      "across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two\r\n",
      "hansoms were standing at the door, and as I entered the passage I heard\r\n",
      "the sound of voices from above. On entering his room, I found Holmes in\r\n",
      "animated conversation with two men, one of whom I recognised as Peter\r\n",
      "Jones, the official police agent, while the other was a long, thin,\r\n",
      "sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable\r\n",
      "frock-coat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHa! Our party is complete,â said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket\r\n",
      "and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. âWatson, I think you\r\n",
      "know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to Mr.\r\n",
      "Merryweather, who is to be our companion in to-nightâs adventure.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWeâre hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see,â said Jones in his\r\n",
      "consequential way. âOur friend here is a wonderful man for starting a\r\n",
      "chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,â\r\n",
      "observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYou may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir,â said the\r\n",
      "police agent loftily. âHe has his own little methods, which are, if he\r\n",
      "wonât mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic,\r\n",
      "but he has the makings of a detective in him. It is not too much to say\r\n",
      "that once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and the\r\n",
      "Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official\r\n",
      "force.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âOh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right,â said the stranger with\r\n",
      "deference. âStill, I confess that I miss my rubber. It is the first\r\n",
      "Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my\r\n",
      "rubber.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI think you will find,â said Sherlock Holmes, âthat you will play for\r\n",
      "a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play\r\n",
      "will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake will be\r\n",
      "some Â£ 30,000; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you\r\n",
      "wish to lay your hands.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âJohn Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. Heâs a young man,\r\n",
      "Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I would\r\n",
      "rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London. Heâs a\r\n",
      "remarkable man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke,\r\n",
      "and he himself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as\r\n",
      "his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never\r\n",
      "know where to find the man himself. Heâll crack a crib in Scotland one\r\n",
      "week, and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next.\r\n",
      "Iâve been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night. Iâve\r\n",
      "had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I agree with\r\n",
      "you that he is at the head of his profession. It is past ten, however,\r\n",
      "and quite time that we started. If you two will take the first hansom,\r\n",
      "Watson and I will follow in the second.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and\r\n",
      "lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the\r\n",
      "afternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets\r\n",
      "until we emerged into Farrington Street.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWe are close there now,â my friend remarked. âThis fellow Merryweather\r\n",
      "is a bank director, and personally interested in the matter. I thought\r\n",
      "it as well to have Jones with us also. He is not a bad fellow, though\r\n",
      "an absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one positive virtue. He\r\n",
      "is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his\r\n",
      "claws upon anyone. Here we are, and they are waiting for us.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found\r\n",
      "ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the\r\n",
      "guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and\r\n",
      "through a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a small\r\n",
      "corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was\r\n",
      "opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated\r\n",
      "at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a\r\n",
      "lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and\r\n",
      "so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was\r\n",
      "piled all round with crates and massive boxes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYou are not very vulnerable from above,â Holmes remarked as he held up\r\n",
      "the lantern and gazed about him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNor from below,â said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the\r\n",
      "flags which lined the floor. âWhy, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!â he\r\n",
      "remarked, looking up in surprise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI must really ask you to be a little more quiet!â said Holmes\r\n",
      "severely. âYou have already imperilled the whole success of our\r\n",
      "expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down\r\n",
      "upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very\r\n",
      "injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon\r\n",
      "the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine\r\n",
      "minutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds sufficed to\r\n",
      "satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his\r\n",
      "pocket.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWe have at least an hour before us,â he remarked, âfor they can hardly\r\n",
      "take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they\r\n",
      "will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer\r\n",
      "time they will have for their escape. We are at present, Doctorâas no\r\n",
      "doubt you have divinedâin the cellar of the City branch of one of the\r\n",
      "principal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors,\r\n",
      "and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring\r\n",
      "criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar\r\n",
      "at present.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIt is our French gold,â whispered the director. âWe have had several\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âYour French gold?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and\r\n",
      "borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France. It\r\n",
      "has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money,\r\n",
      "and that it is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which I sit\r\n",
      "contains 2,000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our\r\n",
      "reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a\r\n",
      "single branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the\r\n",
      "subject.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhich were very well justified,â observed Holmes. âAnd now it is time\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "after all. But I see that the enemyâs preparations have gone so far\r\n",
      "that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must\r\n",
      "choose our positions. These are daring men, and though we shall take\r\n",
      "them at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful.\r\n",
      "I shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind\r\n",
      "those. Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If they\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "I placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind\r\n",

      "before experienced. The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that\r\n",
      "the light was still there, ready to flash out at a momentâs notice. To\r\n",
      "me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was\r\n",
      "something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold\r\n",
      "dank air of the vault.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThey have but one retreat,â whispered Holmes. âThat is back through\r\n",

      "hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have\r\n",
      "almost gone, and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs were weary and\r\n",
      "stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked up\r\n",
      "to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I\r\n",
      "could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but I could\r\n",
      "distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the\r\n",
      "thin, sighing note of the bank director. From my position I could look\r\n",
      "over the case in the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught\r\n",
      "the glint of a light.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it\r\n",
      "lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any\r\n",
      "warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white,\r\n",
      "almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area\r\n",
      "of light. For a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers,\r\n",
      "protruded out of the floor. Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it\r\n",
      "appeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which\r\n",
      "marked a chink between the stones.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Its disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending, tearing\r\n",
      "sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side and\r\n",
      "left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a\r\n",
      "lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which\r\n",
      "looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the\r\n",
      "aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee\r\n",
      "rested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side of the\r\n",
      "hole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like\r\n",
      "himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âItâs all clear,â he whispered. âHave you the chisel and the bags?\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Sherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar.\r\n",
      "The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth\r\n",
      "as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed upon the barrel of a\r\n",
      "revolver, but Holmesâ hunting crop came down on the manâs wrist, and\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âThat is better,â said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow to\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âReally, Mr. Holmes,â said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them from\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am\r\n",
      "amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique,\r\n",

      "obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather\r\n",
      "fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying\r\n",
      "of the _EncyclopÃ¦dia_, must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker\r\n",
      "out of the way for a number of hours every day. It was a curious way of\r\n",
      "managing it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a better.\r\n",
      "The method was no doubt suggested to Clayâs ingenious mind by the\r\n",
      "colour of his accompliceâs hair. The Â£ 4 a week was a lure which must\r\n",
      "draw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands? They\r\n",
      "put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other\r\n",
      "rogue incites the man to apply for it, and together they manage to\r\n",
      "secure his absence every morning in the week. From the time that I\r\n",
      "heard of the assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious to me\r\n",
      "that he had some strong motive for securing the situation.â\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âHad there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere\r\n",
      "vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The manâs\r\n",
      "business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which\r\n",
      "could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure\r\n",
      "as they were at. It must, then, be something out of the house. What\r\n",
      "could it be? I thought of the assistantâs fondness for photography, and\r\n",
      "his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar! There was the end\r\n",
      "of this tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious\r\n",
      "assistant and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest and most\r\n",
      "daring criminals in London. He was doing something in the\r\n",
      "cellarâsomething which took many hours a day for months on end. What\r\n",
      "could it be, once more? I could think of nothing save that he was\r\n",
      "running a tunnel to some other building.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âSo far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I\r\n",
      "surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was\r\n",
      "ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind. It\r\n",
      "was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the assistant\r\n",
      "answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had never set eyes\r\n",
      "upon each other before. I hardly looked at his face. His knees were\r\n",
      "what I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked how worn,\r\n",
      "wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of those hours of\r\n",
      "burrowing. The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for. I\r\n",
      "walked round the corner, saw the City and Suburban Bank abutted on our\r\n",
      "friendâs premises, and felt that I had solved my problem. When you\r\n",

      "they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential that they should\r\n",

      "removed. Saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it\r\n",

      "Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing\r\n",
      "up some small points in connection with it. The husband was a\r\n",
      "teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of was\r\n",
      "that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking\r\n",
      "out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, you will\r\n",

      "feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish Duchess\r\n",
      "of Devonshire fashion over her ear. From under this great panoply she\r\n",
      "peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at our windows, while her\r\n",
      "body oscillated backward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her\r\n",
      "glove buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves\r\n",
      "the bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of\r\n",
      "the bell.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI have seen those symptoms before,â said Holmes, throwing his\r\n",

      "matter is not too delicate for communication. And yet even here we may\r\n",
      "discriminate. When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no\r\n",
      "longer oscillates, and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we\r\n",
      "may take it that there is a love matter, but that the maiden is not so\r\n",
      "much angry as perplexed, or grieved. But here she comes in person to\r\n",

      "pilot boat. Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for\r\n",
      "which he was remarkable, and, having closed the door and bowed her into\r\n",

      "keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of\r\n",
      "her own age. But soon he found that that would not answer forever. She\r\n",
      "became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her\r\n",
      "positive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her clever\r\n",

      "obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a\r\n",
      "real effect were to be produced. There were meetings, and an\r\n",
      "engagement, which would finally secure the girlâs affections from\r\n",
      "turning towards anyone else. But the deception could not be kept up\r\n",
      "forever. These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous. The\r\n",
      "thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a\r\n",

      "young ladyâs mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor\r\n",

      "his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen\r\n",
      "to another man. As far as the church door he brought her, and then, as\r\n",
      "he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished away by the old trick\r\n",
      "of stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler and out at the other. I\r\n",

      "breaking the law now, and not me. I have done nothing actionable from\r\n",

      "too much imagination and too little? Too little, if he could not invent\r\n",

      "about his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the reason why he\r\n",

      "deadly. What could it be? Might not the nature of the injuries reveal\r\n",
      "something to my medical instincts? I rang the bell and called for the\r\n",
      "weekly county paper, which contained a verbatim account of the inquest.\r\n",
      "In the surgeonâs deposition it was stated that the posterior third of\r\n",
      "the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been\r\n",
      "shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I marked the spot upon\r\n",
      "my own head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind.\r\n",

      "that mean? It could not be delirium. A man dying from a sudden blow\r\n",
      "does not commonly become delirious. No, it was more likely to be an\r\n",
      "attempt to explain how he met his fate. But what could it indicate? I\r\n",
      "cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation. And then the\r\n",
      "incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were true\r\n",
      "the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his\r\n",

      "improbabilities the whole thing was! I did not wonder at Lestradeâs\r\n",
      "opinion, and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmesâ insight that I\r\n",

      "done it and was screening him or her, but I am convinced now that he is\r\n",
      "as puzzled as everyone else. He is not a very quick-witted youth,\r\n",

      "Turner.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do,\r\n",
      "but what he knows to be absolutely impossible. It was sheer frenzy of\r\n",
      "this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his\r\n",
      "father, at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss\r\n",
      "Turner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself, and\r\n",
      "his father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would have thrown\r\n",

      "not know where he was. Mark that point. It is of importance. Good has\r\n",
      "come out of evil, however, for the barmaid, finding from the papers\r\n",
      "that he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged, has thrown him\r\n",
      "over utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband\r\n",
      "already in the Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie between\r\n",
      "them. I think that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all\r\n",
      "that he has suffered.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âBut if he is innocent, who has done it?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAh! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two points.\r\n",
      "One is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the\r\n",
      "pool, and that the someone could not have been his son, for his son was\r\n",
      "away, and he did not know when he would return. The second is that the\r\n",
      "murdered man was heard to cry âCooee!â before he knew that his son had\r\n",
      "returned. Those are the crucial points upon which the case depends. And\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "There was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âThere is serious news this morning,â Lestrade observed. âIt is said\r\n",
      "that Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is despaired of.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAn elderly man, I presume?â said Holmes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAbout sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life\r\n",
      "abroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. This business\r\n",
      "has had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend of McCarthyâs,\r\n",
      "and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I have learned that he\r\n",
      "gave him Hatherley Farm rent free.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIndeed! That is interesting,â said Holmes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âOh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody about\r\n",
      "here speaks of his kindness to him.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âReally! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this\r\n",
      "McCarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have been\r\n",
      "under such obligations to Turner, should still talk of marrying his son\r\n",
      "to Turnerâs daughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate, and\r\n",
      "that in such a very cocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of a\r\n",
      "proposal and all else would follow? It is the more strange, since we\r\n",
      "know that Turner himself was averse to the idea. The daughter told us\r\n",
      "as much. Do you not deduce something from that?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWe have got to the deductions and the inferences,â said Lestrade,\r\n",
      "winking at me. âI find it hard enough to tackle facts, Holmes, without\r\n",
      "flying away after theories and fancies.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYou are right,â said Holmes demurely; âyou do find it very hard to\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âAnyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to\r\n",
      "get hold of,â replied Lestrade with some warmth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAnd that isââ\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThat McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that all\r\n",
      "theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWell, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog,â said Holmes, laughing.\r\n",
      "âBut I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon the\r\n",
      "left.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes, that is it.â It was a widespread, comfortable-looking building,\r\n",
      "two-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen upon\r\n",
      "the grey walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however,\r\n",
      "gave it a stricken look, as though the weight of this horror still lay\r\n",
      "heavy upon it. We called at the door, when the maid, at Holmesâ\r\n",
      "request, showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his\r\n",
      "death, and also a pair of the sonâs, though not the pair which he had\r\n",
      "then had. Having measured these very carefully from seven or eight\r\n",
      "different points, Holmes desired to be led to the court-yard, from\r\n",
      "which we all followed the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as\r\n",
      "this. Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of Baker\r\n",
      "Street would have failed to recognise him. His face flushed and\r\n",
      "darkened. His brows were drawn into two hard black lines, while his\r\n",
      "eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter. His face was\r\n",
      "bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and the veins\r\n",
      "stood out like whipcord in his long, sinewy neck. His nostrils seemed\r\n",
      "to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so\r\n",
      "absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or\r\n",
      "remark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a\r\n",
      "quick, impatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way\r\n",
      "along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of the\r\n",
      "woods to the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is all that\r\n",
      "district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon the path and\r\n",
      "amid the short grass which bounded it on either side. Sometimes Holmes\r\n",

      "interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions\r\n",
      "was directed towards a definite end.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some\r\n",
      "fifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley\r\n",
      "Farm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner. Above the woods\r\n",
      "which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red, jutting\r\n",
      "pinnacles which marked the site of the rich landownerâs dwelling. On\r\n",
      "the Hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick, and there was\r\n",
      "a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of\r\n",
      "the trees and the reeds which lined the lake. Lestrade showed us the\r\n",
      "exact spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was\r\n",
      "the ground, that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by\r\n",
      "the fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager\r\n",
      "face and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the\r\n",
      "trampled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and\r\n",
      "then turned upon my companion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhat did you go into the pool for?â he asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon or\r\n",
      "other trace. But how on earthââ\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âOh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its inward\r\n",
      "twist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and there it\r\n",
      "vanishes among the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all have been had I\r\n",
      "been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over\r\n",
      "it. Here is where the party with the lodge-keeper came, and they have\r\n",
      "covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body. But here are\r\n",
      "three separate tracks of the same feet.â He drew out a lens and lay\r\n",
      "down upon his waterproof to have a better view, talking all the time\r\n",
      "rather to himself than to us. âThese are young McCarthyâs feet. Twice\r\n",
      "he was walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles are deeply\r\n",
      "marked and the heels hardly visible. That bears out his story. He ran\r\n",
      "when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are the fatherâs feet\r\n",
      "as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It is the butt-end of the\r\n",
      "gun as the son stood listening. And this? Ha, ha! What have we here?\r\n",
      "Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They come, they go,\r\n",
      "they come againâof course that was for the cloak. Now where did they\r\n",
      "come from?â He ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the\r\n",
      "track until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the\r\n",
      "shadow of a great beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. Holmes\r\n",
      "traced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon\r\n",
      "his face with a little cry of satisfaction. For a long time he remained\r\n",
      "there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks, gathering up what\r\n",
      "seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens\r\n",
      "not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could\r\n",
      "reach. A jagged stone was lying among the moss, and this also he\r\n",
      "carefully examined and retained. Then he followed a pathway through the\r\n",
      "wood until he came to the highroad, where all traces were lost.\r\n",

      "to his natural manner. âI fancy that this grey house on the right must\r\n",
      "be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran, and\r\n",
      "perhaps write a little note. Having done that, we may drive back to our\r\n",

      "in the wood.\r\n",

      "a cigar-holder, and carries a blunt pen-knife in his pocket. There are\r\n",

      "a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other\r\n",
      "ones, both before and after. We have not yet grasped the results which\r\n",

      "will readily see, a possession of all knowledge, which, even in these\r\n",
      "days of free education and encyclopÃ¦dias, is a somewhat rare\r\n",
      "accomplishment. It is not so impossible, however, that a man should\r\n",
      "possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work,\r\n",
      "and this I have endeavoured in my case to do. If I remember rightly,\r\n",
      "you on one occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my\r\n",

      "most lay silent, but some muttered to themselves, and others talked\r\n",
      "together in a strange, low, monotonous voice, their conversation coming\r\n",
      "in gushes, and then suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling\r\n",
      "out his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his\r\n",

      "the fringe of the belt of suburban villas, when he shook himself,\r\n",

      "lived generally in good style. By degrees he made friends in the\r\n",
      "neighbourhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer,\r\n",
      "by whom he now has two children. He had no occupation, but was\r\n",

      "good husband, a very affectionate father, and a man who is popular with\r\n",
      "all who know him. I may add that his whole debts at the present moment,\r\n",
      "as far as we have been able to ascertain, amount to Â£ 88 10_s_., while\r\n",

      "usual, remarking before he started that he had two important\r\n",
      "commissions to perform, and that he would bring his little boy home a\r\n",
      "box of bricks. Now, by the merest chance, his wife received a telegram\r\n",
      "upon this same Monday, very shortly after his departure, to the effect\r\n",
      "that a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting\r\n",

      "not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself. While she was\r\n",
      "walking in this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly heard an\r\n",

      "at her and, as it seemed to her, beckoning to her from a second-floor\r\n",
      "window. The window was open, and she distinctly saw his face, which she\r\n",
      "describes as being terribly agitated. He waved his hands frantically to\r\n",
      "her, and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to\r\n",
      "her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from\r\n",
      "behind. One singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that\r\n",
      "although he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town in, he\r\n",

      "pushed her out into the street. Filled with the most maddening doubts\r\n",
      "and fears, she rushed down the lane and, by rare good-fortune, met in\r\n",
      "Fresno Street a number of constables with an inspector, all on their\r\n",
      "way to their beat. The inspector and two men accompanied her back, and\r\n",
      "in spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor, they made their\r\n",
      "way to the room in which Mr. St. Clair had last been seen. There was no\r\n",
      "sign of him there. In fact, in the whole of that floor there was no one\r\n",
      "to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who, it seems,\r\n",
      "made his home there. Both he and the Lascar stoutly swore that no one\r\n",
      "else had been in the front room during the afternoon. So determined was\r\n",
      "their denial that the inspector was staggered, and had almost come to\r\n",
      "believe that Mrs. St. Clair had been deluded when, with a cry, she\r\n",
      "sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid\r\n",
      "from it. Out there fell a cascade of childrenâs bricks. It was the toy\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âThis discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple showed,\r\n",
      "made the inspector realise that the matter was serious. The rooms were\r\n",
      "carefully examined, and results all pointed to an abominable crime. The\r\n",
      "front room was plainly furnished as a sitting-room and led into a small\r\n",
      "bedroom, which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves. Between\r\n",
      "the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low\r\n",
      "tide but is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of\r\n",
      "water. The bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below. On\r\n",
      "examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill, and\r\n",
      "several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the\r\n",
      "bedroom. Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the\r\n",
      "clothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the exception of his coat. His\r\n",
      "boots, his socks, his hat, and his watchâall were there. There were no\r\n",
      "signs of violence upon any of these garments, and there were no other\r\n",
      "traces of Mr. Neville St. Clair. Out of the window he must apparently\r\n",
      "have gone for no other exit could be discovered, and the ominous\r\n",
      "bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save\r\n",

      "of the tragedy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husbandâs appearance\r\n",
      "at the window, he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the\r\n",
      "crime. His defence was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that\r\n",
      "he had no knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and\r\n",
      "that he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing\r\n",

      "disposal, and I was quickly between the sheets, for I was weary after\r\n",
      "my night of adventure. Sherlock Holmes was a man, however, who, when he\r\n",
      "had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for days, and even for\r\n",
      "a week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts, looking\r\n",
      "at it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or\r\n",
      "convinced himself that his data were insufficient. It was soon evident\r\n",
      "to me that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting. He took off\r\n",
      "his coat and waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then\r\n",
      "wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions\r\n",
      "from the sofa and armchairs. With these he constructed a sort of\r\n",
      "Eastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, with an\r\n",
      "ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him. In\r\n",

      "the light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features. So he sat as I\r\n",
      "dropped off to sleep, and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me\r\n",
      "to wake up, and I found the summer sun shining into the apartment. The\r\n",
      "pipe was still between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the\r\n",
      "room was full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap\r\n",
      "of shag which I had seen upon the previous night.\r\n",

      "âThen dress. No one is stirring yet, but I know where the stable-boy\r\n",
      "sleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out.â He chuckled to himself as\r\n",
      "he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed a different man to the\r\n",
      "sombre thinker of the previous night.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "horse.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI want to test a little theory of mine,â said he, pulling on his\r\n",
      "boots. âI think, Watson, that you are now standing in the presence of\r\n",
      "one of the most absolute fools in Europe. I deserve to be kicked from\r\n",
      "here to Charing Cross. But I think I have the key of the affair now.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAnd where is it?â I asked, smiling.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIn the bathroom,â he answered. âOh, yes, I am not joking,â he\r\n",
      "continued, seeing my look of incredulity. âI have just been there, and\r\n",
      "I have taken it out, and I have got it in this Gladstone bag. Come on,\r\n",
      "my boy, and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock.â\r\n",

      "half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. We both sprang in, and away\r\n",
      "we dashed down the London Road. A few country carts were stirring,\r\n",
      "bearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but the lines of villas on\r\n",
      "either side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIt has been in some points a singular case,â said Holmes, flicking the\r\n",

      "âAh, Bradstreet, how are you?â A tall, stout official had come down the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âYes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is\r\n",
      "as black as a tinkerâs. Well, when once his case has been settled, he\r\n",
      "will have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you saw him, you would\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âThe third on the right is his,â said the inspector. âHere it is!â He\r\n",
      "quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced\r\n",
      "through.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "We both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay with his face\r\n",
      "towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily. He was\r\n",
      "a middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his calling, with a\r\n",
      "coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat. He\r\n",
      "was, as the inspector had said, extremely dirty, but the grime which\r\n",
      "covered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness. A broad\r\n",
      "wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin, and by its\r\n",
      "contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip, so that three\r\n",
      "teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl. A shock of very bright red\r\n",
      "hair grew low over his eyes and forehead.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âHe certainly needs a wash,â remarked Holmes. âI had an idea that he\r\n",
      "might, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me.â He opened\r\n",
      "the Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my astonishment, a very\r\n",
      "large bath-sponge.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHe! he! You are a funny one,â chuckled the inspector.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNow, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very\r\n",
      "quietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWell, I donât know why not,â said the inspector. âHe doesnât look a\r\n",
      "credit to the Bow Street cells, does he?â He slipped his key into the\r\n",
      "lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. The sleeper half\r\n",
      "turned, and then settled down once more into a deep slumber. Holmes\r\n",
      "stooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge, and then rubbed it\r\n",
      "twice vigorously across and down the prisonerâs face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âLet me introduce you,â he shouted, âto Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee,\r\n",
      "in the county of Kent.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Never in my life have I seen such a sight. The manâs face peeled off\r\n",
      "under the sponge like the bark from a tree. Gone was the coarse brown\r\n",
      "tint! Gone, too, was the horrid scar which had seamed it across, and\r\n",
      "the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face! A\r\n",
      "twitch brought away the tangled red hair, and there, sitting up in his\r\n",
      "bed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and\r\n",
      "smooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy\r\n",
      "bewilderment. Then suddenly realising the exposure, he broke into a\r\n",
      "scream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âGreat heavens!â cried the inspector, âit is, indeed, the missing man.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âWith making away with Mr. Neville St.â Oh, come, you canât be charged\r\n",
      "with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it,â said the\r\n",
      "inspector with a grin. âWell, I have been twenty-seven years in the\r\n",
      "force, but this really takes the cake.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIf I am Mr. Neville St. Clair, then it is obvious that no crime has\r\n",
      "been committed, and that, therefore, I am illegally detained.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNo crime, but a very great error has been committed,â said Holmes.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âIt was not the wife; it was the children,â groaned the prisoner. âGod\r\n",

      "exposure! What can I do?â\r\n",

      "convince the police authorities that there is no possible case against\r\n",
      "you, I do not know that there is any reason that the details should\r\n",

      "I travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and finally became a\r\n",
      "reporter on an evening paper in London. One day my editor wished to\r\n",
      "have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis, and I\r\n",
      "volunteered to supply them. There was the point from which all my\r\n",
      "adventures started. It was only by trying begging as an amateur that I\r\n",
      "could get the facts upon which to base my articles. When an actor I\r\n",
      "had, of course, learned all the secrets of making up, and had been\r\n",
      "famous in the green-room for my skill. I took advantage now of my\r\n",
      "attainments. I painted my face, and to make myself as pitiable as\r\n",
      "possible I made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by\r\n",
      "the aid of a small slip of flesh-coloured plaster. Then with a red head\r\n",
      "of hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business\r\n",
      "part of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a beggar.\r\n",
      "For seven hours I plied my trade, and when I returned home in the\r\n",

      "time later, I backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me\r\n",
      "for Â£ 25. I was at my witâs end where to get the money, but a sudden\r\n",
      "idea came to me. I begged a fortnightâs grace from the creditor, asked\r\n",
      "for a holiday from my employers, and spent the time in begging in the\r\n",
      "City under my disguise. In ten days I had the money and had paid the\r\n",
      "debt.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWell, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work\r\n",
      "at Â£ 2 a week when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by\r\n",
      "smearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and\r\n",
      "sitting still. It was a long fight between my pride and the money, but\r\n",
      "the dollars won at last, and I threw up reporting and sat day after day\r\n",
      "in the corner which I had first chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly\r\n",
      "face and filling my pockets with coppers. Only one man knew my secret.\r\n",
      "He was the keeper of a low den in which I used to lodge in Swandam\r\n",
      "Lane, where I could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the\r\n",
      "evenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about town. This\r\n",

      "âWell, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of money.\r\n",
      "I do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London could earn Â£ 700\r\n",
      "a yearâwhich is less than my average takingsâbut I had exceptional\r\n",
      "advantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of\r\n",
      "repartee, which improved by practice and made me quite a recognised\r\n",
      "character in the City. All day a stream of pennies, varied by silver,\r\n",
      "poured in upon me, and it was a very bad day in which I failed to take\r\n",
      "Â£ 2.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAs I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the country,\r\n",

      "horror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the street, with\r\n",
      "her eyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms\r\n",
      "to cover my face, and, rushing to my confidant, the Lascar, entreated\r\n",
      "him to prevent anyone from coming up to me. I heard her voice\r\n",
      "downstairs, but I knew that she could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off\r\n",
      "my clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and\r\n",
      "wig. Even a wifeâs eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. But\r\n",
      "then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and\r\n",
      "that the clothes might betray me. I threw open the window, reopening by\r\n",
      "my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in the\r\n",
      "bedroom that morning. Then I seized my coat, which was weighted by the\r\n",
      "coppers which I had just transferred to it from the leather bag in\r\n",
      "which I carried my takings. I hurled it out of the window, and it\r\n",
      "disappeared into the Thames. The other clothes would have followed, but\r\n",
      "at that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair, and a few\r\n",
      "minutes after I found, rather, I confess, to my relief, that instead of\r\n",
      "being identified as Mr. Neville St. Clair, I was arrested as his\r\n",
      "murderer.\r\n",

      "determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my\r\n",
      "preference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would be terribly\r\n",
      "anxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the Lascar at a\r\n",
      "moment when no constable was watching me, together with a hurried\r\n",
      "scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to fear.â\r\n",

      "touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor of his extended\r\n",
      "hand, recalled Holmesâ surmise as to his habits. His rusty black\r\n",
      "frock-coat was buttoned right up in front, with the collar turned up,\r\n",
      "and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff\r\n",
      "or shirt. He spoke in a slow staccato fashion, choosing his words with\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "day, you understand. This year our good host, Windigate by name,\r\n",
      "instituted a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence\r\n",
      "every week, we were each to receive a bird at Christmas. My pence were\r\n",
      "duly paid, and the rest is familiar to you. I am much indebted to you,\r\n",

      "like so many pistol shots. Our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as\r\n",
      "we swung through the doctorsâ quarter, Wimpole Street, Harley Street,\r\n",
      "and so through Wigmore Street into Oxford Street. In a quarter of an\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âNow for Mr. Breckinridge,â he continued, buttoning up his coat as we\r\n",
      "came out into the frosty air. âRemember, Watson that though we have so\r\n",
      "homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we have at the\r\n",
      "other a man who will certainly get seven yearsâ penal servitude unless\r\n",
      "we can establish his innocence. It is possible that our inquiry may but\r\n",
      "confirm his guilt; but, in any case, we have a line of investigation\r\n",
      "which has been missed by the police, and which a singular chance has\r\n",
      "placed in our hands. Let us follow it out to the bitter end. Faces to\r\n",
      "the south, then, and quick march!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a zigzag\r\n",
      "of slums to Covent Garden Market. One of the largest stalls bore the\r\n",
      "name of Breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor a horsey-looking man,\r\n",
      "with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was helping a boy to put up\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âWarm! Youâd be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am. When I\r\n",
      "pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the\r\n",
      "business; but itâs âWhere are the geese?â and âWho did you sell the\r\n",
      "geese to?â and âWhat will you take for the geese?â One would think they\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âWell, I have no connection with any other people who have been making\r\n",

      "off, that is all. But Iâm always ready to back my opinion on a matter\r\n",
      "of fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the bird I ate is country\r\n",
      "bred.â\r\n",

      "better men before you; but you were not very scrupulous in the means\r\n",
      "you used. It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the making of a very\r\n",
      "pretty villain in you. You knew that this man Horner, the plumber, had\r\n",
      "been concerned in some such matter before, and that suspicion would\r\n",
      "rest the more readily upon him. What did you do, then? You made some\r\n",
      "small job in my ladyâs roomâyou and your confederate Cusackâand you\r\n",
      "managed that he should be the man sent for. Then, when he had left, you\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "once, for I did not know at what moment the police might not take it\r\n",
      "into their heads to search me and my room. There was no place about the\r\n",
      "hotel where it would be safe. I went out, as if on some commission, and\r\n",
      "I made for my sisterâs house. She had married a man named Oakshott, and\r\n",
      "lived in Brixton Road, where she fattened fowls for the market. All the\r\n",
      "way there every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a\r\n",
      "detective; and, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring\r\n",
      "down my face before I came to the Brixton Road. My sister asked me what\r\n",
      "was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I had been\r\n",
      "upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went into the back yard\r\n",

      "into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they could get rid of what\r\n",
      "they stole. I knew that he would be true to me, for I knew one or two\r\n",
      "things about him; so I made up my mind to go right on to Kilburn, where\r\n",
      "he lived, and take him into my confidence. He would show me how to turn\r\n",
      "the stone into money. But how to get to him in safety? I thought of the\r\n",
      "agonies I had gone through in coming from the hotel. I might at any\r\n",
      "moment be seized and searched, and there would be the stone in my\r\n",
      "waistcoat pocket. I was leaning against the wall at the time and\r\n",
      "looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and\r\n",

      "stone to Kilburn. There was a little shed in the yard, and behind this\r\n",
      "I drove one of the birdsâa fine big one, white, with a barred tail. I\r\n",
      "caught it, and prying its bill open, I thrust the stone down its throat\r\n",
      "as far as my finger could reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the\r\n",
      "stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop. But the creature\r\n",
      "flapped and struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the\r\n",
      "matter. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered\r\n",

      "whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am glad to see\r\n",
      "that Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the fire. Pray draw up\r\n",
      "to it, and I shall order you a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that\r\n",
      "you are shivering.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIt is not cold which makes me shiver,â said the woman in a low voice,\r\n",
      "changing her seat as requested.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhat, then?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIt is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror.â She raised her veil as she\r\n",
      "spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of\r\n",
      "agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless frightened eyes,\r\n",
      "like those of some hunted animal. Her features and figure were those of\r\n",
      "a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with premature grey, and her\r\n",
      "expression was weary and haggard. Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one\r\n",
      "of his quick, all-comprehensive glances.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYou must not fear,â said he soothingly, bending forward and patting\r\n",
      "her forearm. âWe shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt. You\r\n",
      "have come in by train this morning, I see.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYou know me, then?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNo, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of\r\n",
      "your left glove. You must have started early, and yet you had a good\r\n",
      "drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the\r\n",
      "station.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my\r\n",
      "companion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThere is no mystery, my dear madam,â said he, smiling. âThe left arm\r\n",
      "of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places. The\r\n",
      "marks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a dog-cart which\r\n",
      "throws up mud in that way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand\r\n",
      "side of the driver.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct,â said she. âI\r\n",
      "started from home before six, reached Leatherhead at twenty past, and\r\n",
      "came in by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, I can stand this strain no\r\n",
      "longer; I shall go mad if it continues. I have no one to turn toânone,\r\n",
      "save only one, who cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little\r\n",
      "aid. I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs.\r\n",
      "Farintosh, whom you helped in the hour of her sore need. It was from\r\n",
      "her that I had your address. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could\r\n",
      "help me, too, and at least throw a little light through the dense\r\n",
      "darkness which surrounds me? At present it is out of my power to reward\r\n",
      "you for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be married,\r\n",
      "with the control of my own income, and then at least you shall not find\r\n",
      "me ungrateful.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Holmes turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small\r\n",
      "case-book, which he consulted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âFarintosh,â said he. âAh yes, I recall the case; it was concerned with\r\n",
      "an opal tiara. I think it was before your time, Watson. I can only say,\r\n",
      "madam, that I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as I\r\n",
      "did to that of your friend. As to reward, my profession is its own\r\n",
      "reward; but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put\r\n",
      "to, at the time which suits you best. And now I beg that you will lay\r\n",

      "entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another, that\r\n",
      "even he to whom of all others I have a right to look for help and\r\n",
      "advice looks upon all that I tell him about it as the fancies of a\r\n",
      "nervous woman. He does not say so, but I can read it from his soothing\r\n",
      "answers and averted eyes. But I have heard, Mr. Holmes, that you can\r\n",
      "see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart. You may\r\n",

      "Hampshire in the west. In the last century, however, four successive\r\n",
      "heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition, and the family ruin\r\n",
      "was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the Regency.\r\n",
      "Nothing was left save a few acres of ground, and the\r\n",
      "two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a heavy\r\n",

      "horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my\r\n",
      "stepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions,\r\n",
      "obtained an advance from a relative, which enabled him to take a\r\n",
      "medical degree and went out to Calcutta, where, by his professional\r\n",
      "skill and his force of character, he established a large practice. In a\r\n",
      "fit of anger, however, caused by some robberies which had been\r\n",
      "perpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler to death and\r\n",
      "narrowly escaped a capital sentence. As it was, he suffered a long term\r\n",

      "than Â£ 1000 a yearâand this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely\r\n",
      "while we resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum\r\n",
      "should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly\r\n",
      "after our return to England my mother diedâshe was killed eight years\r\n",

      "until at last he became the terror of the village, and the folks would\r\n",

      "morning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper, and it has\r\n",
      "awakened me. I cannot tell where it came fromâperhaps from the next\r\n",

      "whether you had heard it.â\r\n",

      "lock.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âQuite so. Pray proceed with your statement.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending misfortune\r\n",
      "impressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you\r\n",
      "know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely\r\n",
      "allied. It was a wild night. The wind was howling outside, and the rain\r\n",
      "was beating and splashing against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the\r\n",
      "hubbub of the gale, there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified\r\n",
      "woman. I knew that it was my sisterâs voice. I sprang from my bed,\r\n",
      "wrapped a shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my\r\n",
      "door I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and a\r\n",
      "few moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen.\r\n",
      "As I ran down the passage, my sisterâs door was unlocked, and revolved\r\n",
      "slowly upon its hinges. I stared at it horror-stricken, not knowing\r\n",
      "what was about to issue from it. By the light of the corridor-lamp I\r\n",
      "saw my sister appear at the opening, her face blanched with terror, her\r\n",
      "hands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that\r\n",
      "of a drunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that\r\n",
      "moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground. She\r\n",
      "writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully\r\n",
      "convulsed. At first I thought that she had not recognised me, but as I\r\n",
      "bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall never\r\n",
      "forget, âOh, my God! Helen! It was the band! The speckled band!â There\r\n",
      "was something else which she would fain have said, and she stabbed with\r\n",
      "her finger into the air in the direction of the Doctorâs room, but a\r\n",
      "fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words. I rushed out, calling\r\n",
      "loudly for my stepfather, and I met him hastening from his room in his\r\n",
      "dressing-gown. When he reached my sisterâs side she was unconscious,\r\n",
      "and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid\r\n",
      "from the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and\r\n",
      "died without having recovered her consciousness. Such was the dreadful\r\n",
      "end of my beloved sister.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âOne moment,â said Holmes, âare you sure about this whistle and\r\n",
      "metallic sound? Could you swear to it?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThat was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is my\r\n",
      "strong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale\r\n",
      "and the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have been deceived.â\r\n",

      "âWas your sister dressed?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNo, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the\r\n",
      "charred stump of a match, and in her left a match-box.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âShowing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the\r\n",
      "alarm took place. That is important. And what conclusions did the\r\n",
      "coroner come to?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHe investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylottâs conduct\r\n",
      "had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any\r\n",
      "satisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that the door had been\r\n",
      "fastened upon the inner side, and the windows were blocked by\r\n",
      "old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars, which were secured every\r\n",
      "night. The walls were carefully sounded, and were shown to be quite\r\n",
      "solid all round, and the flooring was also thoroughly examined, with\r\n",
      "the same result. The chimney is wide, but is barred up by four large\r\n",
      "staples. It is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when\r\n",
      "she met her end. Besides, there were no marks of any violence upon\r\n",
      "her.â\r\n",

      "herald of her own death. I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was\r\n",
      "to be seen in the room. I was too shaken to go to bed again, however,\r\n",
      "so I dressed, and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a\r\n",
      "dog-cart at the Crown Inn, which is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead,\r\n",
      "from whence I have come on this morning with the one object of seeing\r\n",
      "you and asking your advice.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYou have done wisely,â said my friend. âBut have you told me all?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes, all.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âMiss Roylott, you have not. You are screening your stepfather.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhy, what do you mean?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the\r\n",
      "hand that lay upon our visitorâs knee. Five little livid spots, the\r\n",
      "marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white wrist.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYou have been cruelly used,â said Holmes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist. âHe is a\r\n",
      "hard man,â she said, âand perhaps he hardly knows his own strength.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin upon his\r\n",
      "hands and stared into the crackling fire.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThis is a very deep business,â he said at last. âThere are a thousand\r\n",
      "details which I should desire to know before I decide upon our course\r\n",
      "of action. Yet we have not a moment to lose. If we were to come to\r\n",
      "Stoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms\r\n",
      "without the knowledge of your stepfather?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAs it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most\r\n",
      "important business. It is probable that he will be away all day, and\r\n",
      "that there would be nothing to disturb you. We have a housekeeper now,\r\n",
      "but she is old and foolish, and I could easily get her out of the way.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âExcellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âBy no means.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThen we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in\r\n",
      "town. But I shall return by the twelve oâclock train, so as to be there\r\n",
      "in time for your coming.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âNo, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have confided my\r\n",
      "trouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you again this\r\n",
      "afternoon.â She dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided\r\n",
      "from the room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAnd what do you think of it all, Watson?â asked Sherlock Holmes,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âYet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are\r\n",
      "sound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable, then her\r\n",

      "to a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner heard a\r\n",
      "metallic clang, which might have been caused by one of those metal bars\r\n",
      "that secured the shutters falling back into its place, I think that\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âI cannot imagine.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âAnd so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are going to\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our\r\n",
      "door had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed\r\n",
      "himself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar mixture of the\r\n",
      "professional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long\r\n",
      "frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in\r\n",
      "his hand. So tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of\r\n",
      "the doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to\r\n",
      "side. A large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with\r\n",

      "other of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin,\r\n",
      "fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird\r\n",
      "of prey.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âI will do nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been here. I have\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Holmes chuckled heartily. âYour conversation is most entertaining,â\r\n",
      "said he. âWhen you go out close the door, for there is a decided\r\n",
      "draught.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI will go when I have had my say. Donât you dare to meddle with my\r\n",
      "affairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her! I am a\r\n",
      "dangerous man to fall foul of! See here.â He stepped swiftly forward,\r\n",
      "seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âSee that you keep yourself out of my grip,â he snarled, and hurling\r\n",
      "the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHe seems a very amiable person,â said Holmes, laughing. âI am not\r\n",
      "quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my\r\n",
      "grip was not much more feeble than his own.â As he spoke he picked up\r\n",
      "the steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âFancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official\r\n",
      "detective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation,\r\n",
      "however, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer from\r\n",
      "her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. And now, Watson, we\r\n",
      "shall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk down to Doctorsâ\r\n",
      "Commons, where I hope to get some data which may help us in this\r\n",
      "matter.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was nearly one oâclock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his\r\n",
      "excursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over\r\n",
      "with notes and figures.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI have seen the will of the deceased wife,â said he. âTo determine its\r\n",
      "exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices of the\r\n",
      "investments with which it is concerned. The total income, which at the\r\n",
      "time of the wifeâs death was little short of Â£ 1,100, is now, through\r\n",
      "the fall in agricultural prices, not more than Â£ 750. Each daughter can\r\n",
      "claim an income of Â£ 250, in case of marriage. It is evident,\r\n",
      "therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have had a\r\n",
      "mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to a very\r\n",
      "serious extent. My morningâs work has not been wasted, since it has\r\n",
      "proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way\r\n",
      "of anything of the sort. And now, Watson, this is too serious for\r\n",
      "dawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting\r\n",
      "ourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab and\r\n",
      "drive to Waterloo. I should be very much obliged if you would slip your\r\n",
      "revolver into your pocket. An Eleyâs No. 2 is an excellent argument\r\n",
      "with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a\r\n",
      "tooth-brush are, I think, all that we need.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead,\r\n",
      "where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five\r\n",
      "miles through the lovely Surrey lanes. It was a perfect day, with a\r\n",
      "bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens. The trees and\r\n",
      "wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots, and the\r\n",
      "air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth. To me at least\r\n",
      "there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring\r\n",
      "and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged. My companion sat in\r\n",
      "the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over his\r\n",
      "eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the deepest thought.\r\n",
      "Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and pointed\r\n",
      "over the meadows.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âLook there!â said he.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into\r\n",
      "a grove at the highest point. From amid the branches there jutted out\r\n",
      "the grey gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âStoke Moran?â said he.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott,â remarked the\r\n",
      "driver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThere is some building going on there,â said Holmes; âthat is where we\r\n",
      "are going.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThereâs the village,â said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs\r\n",
      "some distance to the left; âbut if you want to get to the house, youâll\r\n",
      "find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the footpath over the\r\n",
      "fields. There it is, where the lady is walking.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAnd the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner,â observed Holmes, shading his\r\n",
      "eyes. âYes, I think we had better do as you suggest.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to\r\n",
      "Leatherhead.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI thought it as well,â said Holmes as we climbed the stile, âthat this\r\n",
      "fellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some definite\r\n",
      "business. It may stop his gossip. Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner. You see\r\n",
      "that we have been as good as our word.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face\r\n",
      "which spoke her joy. âI have been waiting so eagerly for you,â she\r\n",
      "cried, shaking hands with us warmly. âAll has turned out splendidly.\r\n",
      "Dr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back\r\n",
      "before evening.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWe have had the pleasure of making the Doctorâs acquaintance,â said\r\n",
      "Holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred. Miss\r\n",
      "Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âGood heavens!â she cried, âhe has followed me, then.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âSo it appears.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHe is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What will\r\n",
      "he say when he returns?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHe must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more\r\n",
      "cunning than himself upon his track. You must lock yourself up from him\r\n",
      "to-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to your auntâs at\r\n",
      "Harrow. Now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us\r\n",
      "at once to the rooms which we are to examine.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central\r\n",
      "portion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on\r\n",
      "each side. In one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked\r\n",
      "with wooden boards, while the roof was partly caved in, a picture of\r\n",
      "ruin. The central portion was in little better repair, but the\r\n",
      "right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the\r\n",
      "windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that\r\n",
      "this was where the family resided. Some scaffolding had been erected\r\n",
      "against the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but\r\n",
      "there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes\r\n",
      "walked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep\r\n",
      "attention the outsides of the windows.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThis, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the\r\n",
      "centre one to your sisterâs, and the one next to the main building to\r\n",
      "Dr. Roylottâs chamber?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âExactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âPending the alterations, as I understand. By the way, there does not\r\n",
      "seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThere were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my\r\n",
      "room.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAh! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow wing\r\n",
      "runs the corridor from which these three rooms open. There are windows\r\n",
      "in it, of course?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes, but very small ones. Too narrow for anyone to pass through.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAs you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable\r\n",
      "from that side. Now, would you have the kindness to go into your room\r\n",
      "and bar your shutters?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Miss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through the\r\n",
      "open window, endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open, but\r\n",
      "without success. There was no slit through which a knife could be\r\n",
      "passed to raise the bar. Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but\r\n",
      "they were of solid iron, built firmly into the massive masonry. âHum!â\r\n",
      "said he, scratching his chin in some perplexity, âmy theory certainly\r\n",
      "presents some difficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they\r\n",
      "were bolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the\r\n",
      "matter.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the\r\n",
      "three bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third chamber, so\r\n",
      "we passed at once to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now\r\n",
      "sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate. It was a\r\n",
      "homely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after\r\n",
      "the fashion of old country-houses. A brown chest of drawers stood in\r\n",
      "one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a\r\n",
      "dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window. These articles,\r\n",
      "with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the\r\n",
      "room save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards round\r\n",
      "and the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old\r\n",
      "and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of\r\n",
      "the house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent,\r\n",
      "while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in\r\n",
      "every detail of the apartment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhere does that bell communicate with?â he asked at last pointing to a\r\n",
      "thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually\r\n",
      "lying upon the pillow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIt goes to the housekeeperâs room.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIt looks newer than the other things?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYour sister asked for it, I suppose?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNo, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we\r\n",
      "wanted for ourselves.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIndeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there. You\r\n",
      "will excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this\r\n",
      "floor.â He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand\r\n",
      "and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks\r\n",
      "between the boards. Then he did the same with the wood-work with which\r\n",
      "the chamber was panelled. Finally he walked over to the bed and spent\r\n",
      "some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âNo, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You\r\n",

      "âHow very absurd! I never noticed that before.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âVery strange!â muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. âThere are one or\r\n",
      "two very singular points about this room. For example, what a fool a\r\n",
      "builder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the\r\n",
      "same trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!â\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âYes, there were several little changes carried out about that time.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThey seem to have been of a most interesting characterâdummy\r\n",
      "bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Dr. Grimesby Roylottâs chamber was larger than that of his\r\n",
      "step-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a small wooden\r\n",
      "shelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an armchair\r\n",
      "beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table,\r\n",
      "and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye.\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "the top of it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNo; we donât keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAh, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a\r\n",
      "saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I daresay.\r\n",
      "There is one point which I should wish to determine.â He squatted down\r\n",

      "greatest attention.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one\r\n",

      "when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all. I\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âYes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âSubtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong he is\r\n",
      "the first of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge. Palmer and\r\n",
      "Pritchard were among the heads of their profession. This man strikes\r\n",
      "even deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall be able to strike\r\n",

      "light shone out right in front of us.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "possible that we might spend the night there. A moment later we were\r\n",
      "out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow\r\n",
      "light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our\r\n",
      "sombre errand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired\r\n",
      "breaches gaped in the old park wall. Making our way among the trees, we\r\n",
      "reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the\r\n",
      "window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed\r\n",
      "to be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the grass\r\n",
      "with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the\r\n",

      "I had forgotten the strange pets which the Doctor affected. There was a\r\n",
      "cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any\r\n",
      "moment. I confess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following\r\n",
      "Holmesâ example and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the\r\n",
      "bedroom. My companion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp\r\n",
      "onto the table, and cast his eyes round the room. All was as we had\r\n",
      "seen it in the daytime. Then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of\r\n",
      "his hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that\r\n",
      "I could do to distinguish the words:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThe least sound would be fatal to our plans.â\r\n",

      "you in that chair.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "beside him. By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle.\r\n",
      "Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left in darkness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "How shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a sound,\r\n",
      "not even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my companion sat\r\n",
      "open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous\r\n",
      "tension in which I was myself. The shutters cut off the least ray of\r\n",
      "light, and we waited in absolute darkness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "From outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our\r\n",
      "very window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that the cheetah\r\n",
      "was indeed at liberty. Far away we could hear the deep tones of the\r\n",
      "parish clock, which boomed out every quarter of an hour. How long they\r\n",
      "seemed, those quarters! Twelve struck, and one and two and three, and\r\n",
      "still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction\r\n",
      "of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a\r\n",
      "strong smell of burning oil and heated metal. Someone in the next room\r\n",
      "had lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle sound of movement, and then\r\n",
      "all was silent once more, though the smell grew stronger. For half an\r\n",
      "hour I sat with straining ears. Then suddenly another sound became\r\n",
      "audibleâa very gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of\r\n",
      "steam escaping continually from a kettle. The instant that we heard it,\r\n",
      "Holmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with\r\n",
      "his cane at the bell-pull.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYou see it, Watson?â he yelled. âYou see it?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard a\r\n",
      "low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes\r\n",
      "made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed\r\n",
      "so savagely. I could, however, see that his face was deadly pale and\r\n",
      "filled with horror and loathing. He had ceased to strike and was gazing\r\n",
      "up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the\r\n",
      "night the most horrible cry to which I have ever listened. It swelled\r\n",
      "up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all\r\n",
      "mingled in the one dreadful shriek. They say that away down in the\r\n",
      "village, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the\r\n",
      "sleepers from their beds. It struck cold to our hearts, and I stood\r\n",
      "gazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it had died\r\n",
      "away into the silence from which it rose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhat can it mean?â I gasped.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIt means that it is all over,â Holmes answered. âAnd perhaps, after\r\n",
      "all, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we will enter Dr.\r\n",
      "Roylottâs room.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor.\r\n",
      "Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within. Then\r\n",
      "he turned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked\r\n",
      "pistol in my hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a\r\n",
      "dark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam of\r\n",
      "light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar. Beside this\r\n",
      "table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott clad in a long\r\n",
      "grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet\r\n",
      "thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers. Across his lap lay the short\r\n",
      "stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day. His chin\r\n",
      "was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at\r\n",
      "the corner of the ceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow\r\n",
      "band, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round\r\n",
      "his head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThe band! the speckled band!â whispered Holmes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began to\r\n",

      "discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to the\r\n",

      "discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a\r\n",
      "clever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training. The rapidity\r\n",
      "with which such a poison would take effect would also, from his point\r\n",

      "could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where\r\n",
      "the poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the whistle. Of\r\n",

      "the victim. He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which we\r\n",
      "saw, to return to him when summoned. He would put it through this\r\n",
      "ventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it\r\n",
      "would crawl down the rope and land on the bed. It might or might not\r\n",
      "bite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but\r\n",
      "sooner or later she must fall a victim.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room. An\r\n",

      "necessity for my coming at midnight, and his extreme anxiety lest I\r\n",
      "should tell anyone of my errand. However, I threw all fears to the\r\n",

      "the rate that we seemed to go, and from the time that we took, that it\r\n",
      "must have been nearer twelve. He sat at my side in silence all the\r\n",
      "time, and I was aware, more than once when I glanced in his direction,\r\n",
      "that he was looking at me with great intensity. The country roads seem\r\n",
      "to be not very good in that part of the world, for we lurched and\r\n",
      "jolted terribly. I tried to look out of the windows to see something of\r\n",
      "where we were, but they were made of frosted glass, and I could make\r\n",
      "out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light. Now and\r\n",
      "then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey, but\r\n",
      "the colonel answered only in monosyllables, and the conversation soon\r\n",
      "flagged. At last, however, the bumping of the road was exchanged for\r\n",
      "the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive, and the carriage came to a\r\n",
      "stand. Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out, and, as I followed after him,\r\n",
      "pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us. We stepped,\r\n",
      "as it were, right out of the carriage and into the hall, so that I\r\n",
      "failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house. The\r\n",
      "instant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily\r\n",
      "behind us, and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage\r\n",
      "drove away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIt was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled about\r\n",
      "looking for matches and muttering under his breath. Suddenly a door\r\n",
      "opened at the other end of the passage, and a long, golden bar of light\r\n",
      "shot out in our direction. It grew broader, and a woman appeared with a\r\n",
      "lamp in her hand, which she held above her head, pushing her face\r\n",
      "forward and peering at us. I could see that she was pretty, and from\r\n",
      "the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it\r\n",
      "was a rich material. She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a\r\n",
      "tone as though asking a question, and when my companion answered in a\r\n",
      "gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from\r\n",
      "her hand. Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered something in her ear,\r\n",
      "and then, pushing her back into the room from whence she had come, he\r\n",
      "walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "ââPerhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few\r\n",
      "minutes,â said he, throwing open another door. It was a quiet, little,\r\n",
      "plainly furnished room, with a round table in the centre, on which\r\n",
      "several German books were scattered. Colonel Stark laid down the lamp\r\n",
      "on the top of a harmonium beside the door. âI shall not keep you\r\n",
      "waiting an instant,â said he, and vanished into the darkness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my ignorance of\r\n",
      "German I could see that two of them were treatises on science, the\r\n",
      "others being volumes of poetry. Then I walked across to the window,\r\n",
      "hoping that I might catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak\r\n",
      "shutter, heavily barred, was folded across it. It was a wonderfully\r\n",
      "silent house. There was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the\r\n",
      "passage, but otherwise everything was deadly still. A vague feeling of\r\n",
      "uneasiness began to steal over me. Who were these German people, and\r\n",
      "what were they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way place? And\r\n",
      "where was the place? I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was all I\r\n",
      "knew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no idea. For that\r\n",
      "matter, Reading, and possibly other large towns, were within that\r\n",
      "radius, so the place might not be so secluded, after all. Yet it was\r\n",
      "quite certain, from the absolute stillness, that we were in the\r\n",
      "country. I paced up and down the room, humming a tune under my breath\r\n",
      "to keep up my spirits and feeling that I was thoroughly earning my\r\n",
      "fifty-guinea fee.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âSuddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter\r\n",
      "stillness, the door of my room swung slowly open. The woman was\r\n",
      "standing in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the\r\n",
      "yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face. I\r\n",
      "could see at a glance that she was sick with fear, and the sight sent a\r\n",
      "chill to my own heart. She held up one shaking finger to warn me to be\r\n",
      "silent, and she shot a few whispered words of broken English at me, her\r\n",
      "eyes glancing back, like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom\r\n",
      "behind her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "ââI would go,â said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to speak\r\n",
      "calmly; âI would go. I should not stay here. There is no good for you\r\n",
      "to do.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "ââBut, madam,â said I, âI have not yet done what I came for. I cannot\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "ââIt is not worth your while to wait,â she went on. âYou can pass\r\n",
      "through the door; no one hinders.â And then, seeing that I smiled and\r\n",
      "shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step\r\n",
      "forward, with her hands wrung together. âFor the love of Heaven!â she\r\n",
      "whispered, âget away from here before it is too late!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âBut I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to engage\r\n",
      "in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way. I thought of my\r\n",
      "fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of the unpleasant night\r\n",
      "which seemed to be before me. Was it all to go for nothing? Why should\r\n",
      "I slink away without having carried out my commission, and without the\r\n",
      "payment which was my due? This woman might, for all I knew, be a\r\n",
      "monomaniac. With a stout bearing, therefore, though her manner had\r\n",
      "shaken me more than I cared to confess, I still shook my head and\r\n",
      "declared my intention of remaining where I was. She was about to renew\r\n",
      "her entreaties when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several\r\n",
      "footsteps was heard upon the stairs. She listened for an instant, threw\r\n",
      "up her hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and as\r\n",
      "noiselessly as she had come.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "ââOn the contrary,â said I, âI opened the door myself because I felt\r\n",
      "the room to be a little close.â\r\n",

      "manager and I behind him. It was a labyrinth of an old house, with\r\n",
      "corridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little low doors,\r\n",
      "the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had\r\n",

      "descending piston, and it comes down with the force of many tons upon\r\n",
      "this metal floor. There are small lateral columns of water outside\r\n",
      "which receive the force, and which transmit and multiply it in the\r\n",
      "manner which is familiar to you. The machine goes readily enough, but\r\n",
      "there is some stiffness in the working of it, and it has lost a little\r\n",
      "of its force. Perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to\r\n",
      "show us how we can set it right.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very thoroughly.\r\n",
      "It was indeed a gigantic one, and capable of exercising enormous\r\n",
      "pressure. When I passed outside, however, and pressed down the levers\r\n",
      "which controlled it, I knew at once by the whishing sound that there\r\n",
      "was a slight leakage, which allowed a regurgitation of water through\r\n",
      "one of the side cylinders. An examination showed that one of the\r\n",
      "india-rubber bands which was round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk\r\n",
      "so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked. This was\r\n",
      "clearly the cause of the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my\r\n",
      "companions, who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several\r\n",
      "practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right. When\r\n",
      "I had made it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the\r\n",
      "machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity. It was\r\n",
      "obvious at a glance that the story of the fullerâs-earth was the merest\r\n",
      "fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an\r\n",
      "engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose. The walls were of\r\n",
      "wood, but the floor consisted of a large iron trough, and when I came\r\n",
      "to examine it I could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it. I\r\n",
      "had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when I\r\n",
      "heard a muttered exclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of\r\n",
      "the colonel looking down at me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "ââWhat are you doing there?â he asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that\r\n",
      "which he had told me. âI was admiring your fullerâs-earth,â said I; âI\r\n",
      "think that I should be better able to advise you as to your machine if\r\n",
      "I knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThe instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of my\r\n",
      "speech. His face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in his grey\r\n",
      "eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "ââVery well,â said he, âyou shall know all about the machine.â He took\r\n",
      "a step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key in the\r\n",
      "lock. I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it was quite\r\n",
      "secure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves. âHullo!â\r\n",
      "I yelled. âHullo! Colonel! Let me out!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAnd then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my heart\r\n",
      "into my mouth. It was the clank of the levers and the swish of the\r\n",
      "leaking cylinder. He had set the engine at work. The lamp still stood\r\n",
      "upon the floor where I had placed it when examining the trough. By its\r\n",
      "light I saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly,\r\n",
      "jerkily, but, as none knew better than myself, with a force which must\r\n",
      "within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp. I threw myself,\r\n",
      "screaming, against the door, and dragged with my nails at the lock. I\r\n",
      "implored the colonel to let me out, but the remorseless clanking of the\r\n",
      "levers drowned my cries. The ceiling was only a foot or two above my\r\n",
      "head, and with my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface.\r\n",
      "Then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend\r\n",
      "very much upon the position in which I met it. If I lay on my face the\r\n",
      "weight would come upon my spine, and I shuddered to think of that\r\n",
      "dreadful snap. Easier the other way, perhaps; and yet, had I the nerve\r\n",
      "to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me?\r\n",
      "Already I was unable to stand erect, when my eye caught something which\r\n",
      "brought a gush of hope back to my heart.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the walls\r\n",
      "were of wood. As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw a thin line\r\n",
      "of yellow light between two of the boards, which broadened and\r\n",
      "broadened as a small panel was pushed backward. For an instant I could\r\n",
      "hardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death.\r\n",
      "The next instant I threw myself through, and lay half-fainting upon the\r\n",
      "other side. The panel had closed again behind me, but the crash of the\r\n",
      "lamp, and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal,\r\n",
      "told me how narrow had been my escape.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and I\r\n",
      "found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor, while a\r\n",
      "woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand, while she held\r\n",
      "a candle in her right. It was the same good friend whose warning I had\r\n",
      "so foolishly rejected.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "ââCome! come!â she cried breathlessly. âThey will be here in a moment.\r\n",
      "They will see that you are not there. Oh, do not waste the so-precious\r\n",
      "time, but come!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThis time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to my\r\n",
      "feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair. The\r\n",
      "latter led to another broad passage, and just as we reached it we heard\r\n",
      "the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices, one answering\r\n",
      "the other from the floor on which  we were and from the one beneath. My\r\n",
      "guide stopped and looked about her like one  who is at her witâs end.\r\n",
      "Then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom, through the window\r\n",
      "of which the moon was shining brightly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "ââIt is your only chance,â said she. âIt is high, but it may be that\r\n",
      "you can jump it.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAs she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the\r\n",
      "passage, and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark rushing\r\n",
      "forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcherâs\r\n",
      "cleaver in the other. I rushed across the bedroom, flung open the\r\n",
      "window, and looked out. How quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden\r\n",
      "looked in the moonlight, and it could not be more than thirty feet\r\n",
      "down. I clambered out upon the sill, but I hesitated to jump until I\r\n",
      "should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who\r\n",
      "pursued me. If she were ill-used, then at any risks I was determined to\r\n",
      "go back to her assistance. The thought had hardly flashed through my\r\n",
      "mind before he was at the door, pushing his way past her; but she threw\r\n",
      "her arms round him and tried to hold him back.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "ââFritz! Fritz!â she cried in English, âremember your promise after the\r\n",
      "last time. You said it should not be again. He will be silent! Oh, he\r\n",
      "will be silent!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "ââYou are mad, Elise!â he shouted, struggling to break away from her.\r\n",
      "âYou will be the ruin of us. He has seen too much. Let me pass, I say!â\r\n",
      "He dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the window, cut at me with\r\n",
      "his heavy weapon. I had let myself go, and was hanging by the hands to\r\n",
      "the sill, when his blow fell. I was conscious of a dull pain, my grip\r\n",
      "loosened, and I fell into the garden below.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and\r\n",
      "rushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I understood\r\n",
      "that I was far from being out of danger yet. Suddenly, however, as I\r\n",
      "ran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me. I glanced down at my\r\n",
      "hand, which was throbbing painfully, and then, for the first time, saw\r\n",
      "that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my\r\n",
      "wound. I endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it, but there came a\r\n",
      "sudden buzzing in my ears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among\r\n",
      "the rose-bushes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHow long I remained unconscious I cannot tell. It must have been a\r\n",
      "very long time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was\r\n",
      "breaking when I came to myself. My clothes were all sodden with dew,\r\n",
      "and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb. The\r\n",
      "smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my nightâs\r\n",
      "adventure, and I sprang to my feet with the feeling that I might hardly\r\n",
      "yet be safe from my pursuers. But to my astonishment, when I came to\r\n",
      "look round me, neither house nor garden were to be seen. I had been\r\n",
      "lying in an angle of the hedge close by the highroad, and just a little\r\n",
      "lower down was a long building, which proved, upon my approaching it,\r\n",
      "to be the very station at which I had arrived upon the previous night.\r\n",
      "Were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed during\r\n",
      "those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHalf dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning train.\r\n",
      "There would be one to Reading in less than an hour. The same porter was\r\n",
      "on duty, I found, as had been there when I arrived. I inquired of him\r\n",
      "whether he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark. The name was\r\n",
      "strange to him. Had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for\r\n",
      "me? No, he had not. Was there a police-station anywhere near? There was\r\n",
      "one about three miles off.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIt was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I determined to\r\n",
      "wait until I got back to town before telling my story to the police. It\r\n",
      "was a little past six when I arrived, so I went first to have my wound\r\n",
      "dressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here. I\r\n",
      "put the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you advise.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this\r\n",
      "extraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the\r\n",
      "shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his\r\n",
      "cuttings.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHere is an advertisement which will interest you,â said he. âIt\r\n",
      "appeared in all the papers about a year ago. Listen to this: âLost, on\r\n",
      "the 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged twenty-six, a hydraulic\r\n",
      "engineer. Left his lodgings at ten oâclock at night, and has not been\r\n",
      "heard of since. Was dressed in,â etc., etc. Ha! That represents the\r\n",
      "last time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, I\r\n",
      "fancy.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âGood heavens!â cried my patient. âThen that explains what the girl\r\n",
      "said.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âUndoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and\r\n",
      "desperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand\r\n",
      "in the way of his little game, like those out-and-out pirates who will\r\n",
      "leave no survivor from a captured ship. Well, every moment now is\r\n",
      "precious, so if you feel equal to it we shall go down to Scotland Yard\r\n",
      "at once as a preliminary to starting for Eyford.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together,\r\n",
      "bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village. There were Sherlock\r\n",
      "Holmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard,\r\n",
      "a plain-clothes man, and myself. Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map\r\n",
      "of the county out upon the seat and was busy with his compasses drawing\r\n",
      "a circle with Eyford for its centre.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThere you are,â said he. âThat circle is drawn at a radius of ten\r\n",
      "miles from the village. The place we want must be somewhere near that\r\n",
      "line. You said ten miles, I think, sir.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIt was an hourâs good drive.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAnd you think that they brought you back all that way when you were\r\n",
      "unconscious?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThey must have done so. I have a confused memory, too, of having been\r\n",
      "lifted and conveyed somewhere.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhat I cannot understand,â said I, âis why they should have spared you\r\n",
      "when they found you lying fainting in the garden. Perhaps the villain\r\n",
      "was softened by the womanâs entreaties.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable face in my\r\n",
      "life.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âOh, we shall soon clear up all that,â said Bradstreet. âWell, I have\r\n",
      "drawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon it the folk\r\n",
      "that we are in search of are to be found.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI think I could lay my finger on it,â said Holmes quietly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âReally, now!â cried the inspector, âyou have formed your opinion!\r\n",
      "Come, now, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it is south, for the\r\n",
      "country is more deserted there.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAnd I say east,â said my patient.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI am for west,â remarked the plain-clothes man. âThere are several\r\n",
      "quiet little villages up there.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAnd I am for north,â said I, âbecause there are no hills there, and\r\n",
      "our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âCome,â cried the inspector, laughing; âitâs a very pretty diversity of\r\n",
      "opinion. We have boxed the compass among us. Who do you give your\r\n",
      "casting vote to?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYou are all wrong.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âBut we canât all be.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âOh, yes, you can. This is my point.â He placed his finger in the\r\n",
      "centre of the circle. âThis is where we shall find them.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âBut the twelve-mile drive?â gasped Hatherley.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âSix out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself that the horse\r\n",
      "was fresh and glossy when you got in. How could it be that if it had\r\n",
      "gone twelve miles over heavy roads?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIndeed, it is a likely ruse enough,â observed Bradstreet thoughtfully.\r\n",
      "âOf course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNone at all,â said Holmes. âThey are coiners on a large scale, and\r\n",
      "have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of\r\n",
      "silver.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWe have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,â said the\r\n",
      "inspector. âThey have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand. We\r\n",
      "even traced them as far as Reading, but could get no farther, for they\r\n",
      "had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old\r\n",
      "hands. But now, thanks to this lucky chance, I think that we have got\r\n",
      "them right enough.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not destined\r\n",
      "to fall into the hands of justice. As we rolled into Eyford Station we\r\n",
      "saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small\r\n",
      "clump of trees in the neighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich\r\n",
      "feather over the landscape.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âA house on fire?â asked Bradstreet as the train steamed off again on\r\n",
      "its way.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes, sir!â said the station-master.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhen did it break out?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse, and\r\n",
      "the whole place is in a blaze.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhose house is it?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âDr. Becherâs.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âTell me,â broke in the engineer, âis Dr. Becher a German, very thin,\r\n",
      "with a long, sharp nose?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The station-master laughed heartily. âNo, sir, Dr. Becher is an\r\n",
      "Englishman, and there isnât a man in the parish who has a better-lined\r\n",
      "waistcoat. But he has a gentleman staying with him, a patient, as I\r\n",
      "understand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as if a little good\r\n",
      "Berkshire beef would do him no harm.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The station-master had not finished his speech before we were all\r\n",
      "hastening in the direction of the fire. The road topped a low hill, and\r\n",
      "there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us,\r\n",
      "spouting fire at every chink and window, while in the garden in front\r\n",
      "three fire-engines were vainly striving to keep the flames under.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThatâs it!â cried Hatherley, in intense excitement. âThere is the\r\n",
      "gravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay. That second\r\n",
      "window is the one that I jumped from.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWell, at least,â said Holmes, âyou have had your revenge upon them.\r\n",
      "There can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which, when it was\r\n",
      "crushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls, though no doubt\r\n",
      "they were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time.\r\n",
      "Now keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night,\r\n",
      "though I very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And Holmesâ fears came to be realised, for from that day to this no\r\n",
      "word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the sinister\r\n",
      "German, or the morose Englishman. Early that morning a peasant had met\r\n",
      "a cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving\r\n",
      "rapidly in the direction of Reading, but there all traces of the\r\n",
      "fugitives disappeared, and even Holmesâ ingenuity failed ever to\r\n",
      "discover the least clue as to their whereabouts.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which\r\n",
      "they had found within, and still more so by discovering a newly severed\r\n",
      "human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor. About sunset,\r\n",
      "however, their efforts were at last successful, and they subdued the\r\n",

      "hand, though; so he followed me there, and he saw me without Pa knowing\r\n",
      "anything about it. It would only have made him mad to know, so we just\r\n",
      "fixed it all up for ourselves. Frank said that he would go and make his\r\n",
      "pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had as much as Pa.\r\n",
      "So then I promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged\r\n",
      "myself not to marry anyone else while he lived. âWhy shouldnât we be\r\n",

      "all ready in waiting, that we just did it right there; and then Frank\r\n",
      "went off to seek his fortune, and I went back to Pa.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThe next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then he went\r\n",
      "prospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New Mexico. After\r\n",
      "that came a long newspaper story about how a minersâ camp had been\r\n",

      "Frank was really dead. Then Lord St. Simon came to âFrisco, and we came\r\n",
      "to London, and a marriage was arranged, and Pa was very pleased, but I\r\n",
      "felt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place\r\n",
      "in my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âStill, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course Iâd have done my\r\n",
      "duty by him. We canât command our love, but we can our actions. I went\r\n",
      "to the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a\r\n",
      "wife as it was in me to be. But you may imagine what I felt when, just\r\n",
      "as I came to the altar rails, I glanced back and saw Frank standing and\r\n",
      "looking at me out of the first pew. I thought it was his ghost at\r\n",
      "first; but when I looked again there he was still, with a kind of\r\n",
      "question in his eyes, as if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to\r\n",
      "see him. I wonder I didnât drop. I know that everything was turning\r\n",
      "round, and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee\r\n",
      "in my ear. I didnât know what to do. Should I stop the service and make\r\n",
      "a scene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to know\r\n",
      "what I was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to\r\n",
      "be still. Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper, and I knew that\r\n",
      "he was writing me a note. As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped\r\n",
      "my bouquet over to him, and he slipped the note into my hand when he\r\n",
      "returned me the flowers. It was only a line asking me to join him when\r\n",
      "he made the sign to me to do so. Of course I never doubted for a moment\r\n",
      "that my first duty was now to him, and I determined to do just whatever\r\n",
      "he might direct.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhen I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California, and\r\n",

      "few things packed and my ulster ready. I know I ought to have spoken to\r\n",
      "Lord St. Simon, but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all\r\n",
      "those great people. I just made up my mind to run away and explain\r\n",
      "afterwards. I hadnât been at the table ten minutes before I saw Frank\r\n",
      "out of the window at the other side of the road. He beckoned to me and\r\n",
      "then began walking into the Park. I slipped out, put on my things, and\r\n",
      "followed him. Some woman came talking something or other about Lord St.\r\n",
      "Simon to meâseemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a little\r\n",
      "secret of his own before marriage alsoâbut I managed to get away from\r\n",
      "her and soon overtook Frank. We got into a cab together, and away we\r\n",
      "drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and that was my\r\n",
      "true wedding after all those years of waiting. Frank had been a\r\n",
      "prisoner among the Apaches, had escaped, came on to âFrisco, found that\r\n",
      "I had given him up for dead and had gone to England, followed me there,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âThen we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all for\r\n",

      "like to vanish away and never see any of them againâjust sending a line\r\n",
      "to Pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It was awful to me to\r\n",
      "think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfast-table\r\n",
      "and waiting for me to come back. So Frank took my wedding-clothes and\r\n",
      "things and made a bundle of them, so that I should not be traced, and\r\n",
      "dropped them away somewhere where no one could find them. It is likely\r\n",
      "that we should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that this good\r\n",
      "gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening, though how he\r\n",
      "found us is more than I can think, and he showed us very clearly and\r\n",
      "kindly that I was wrong and that Frank was right, and that we should be\r\n",
      "putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret. Then he offered to\r\n",
      "give us a chance of talking to Lord St. Simon alone, and so we came\r\n",
      "right away round to his rooms at once. Now, Robert, you have heard it\r\n",
      "all, and I am very sorry if I have given you pain, and I hope that you\r\n",
      "do not think very meanly of me.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but had\r\n",

      "narrative.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âExcuse me,â he said, âbut it is not my custom to discuss my most\r\n",

      "that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home.\r\n",
      "Obviously something had occurred during the morning, then, to cause her\r\n",
      "to change her mind. What could that something be? She could not have\r\n",
      "spoken to anyone when she was out, for she had been in the company of\r\n",
      "the bridegroom. Had she seen someone, then? If she had, it must be\r\n",
      "someone from America because she had spent so short a time in this\r\n",
      "country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an\r\n",
      "influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to\r\n",
      "change her plans so completely. You see we have already arrived, by a\r\n",
      "process of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an American.\r\n",
      "Then who could this American be, and why should he possess so much\r\n",
      "influence over her? It might be a lover; it might be a husband. Her\r\n",

      "parlance means taking possession of that which another person has a\r\n",
      "prior claim toâthe whole situation became absolutely clear. She had\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âIt might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held information in\r\n",
      "his hands the value of which he did not himself know. The initials\r\n",
      "were, of course, of the highest importance, but more valuable still was\r\n",

      "character, however, and has always given me satisfaction. She is a very\r\n",
      "pretty girl and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about\r\n",
      "the place. That is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we\r\n",

      "to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the handling of large sums\r\n",
      "of money. When he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club,\r\n",
      "and there, having charming manners, he was soon the intimate of a\r\n",
      "number of men with long purses and expensive habits. He learned to play\r\n",

      "and again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his\r\n",
      "allowance, that he might settle his debts of honour. He tried more than\r\n",
      "once to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping, but\r\n",

      "to his finger-tips, one who had been everywhere, seen everything, a\r\n",
      "brilliant talker, and a man of great personal beauty. Yet when I think\r\n",

      "an hour to glancing a little more closely into details.â\r\n",

      "of the bankerâs son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his\r\n",
      "unhappy father, but still I had such faith in Holmesâ judgment that I\r\n",
      "felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was\r\n",
      "dissatisfied with the accepted explanation. He hardly spoke a word the\r\n",
      "whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his\r\n",
      "breast and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought.\r\n",
      "Our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of\r\n",
      "hope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a\r\n",
      "desultory chat with me over his business affairs. A short railway\r\n",
      "journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest residence\r\n",
      "of the great financier.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back a\r\n",
      "little from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn,\r\n",
      "stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the\r\n",
      "entrance. On the right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into\r\n",
      "a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the\r\n",
      "kitchen door, and forming the tradesmenâs entrance. On the left ran a\r\n",
      "lane which led to the stables, and was not itself within the grounds at\r\n",
      "all, being a public, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us\r\n",
      "standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the\r\n",
      "front, down the tradesmenâs path, and so round by the garden behind\r\n",
      "into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I went into\r\n",
      "the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return. We were\r\n",
      "sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in.\r\n",
      "She was rather above the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes,\r\n",
      "which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin. I do\r\n",
      "not think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a womanâs face.\r\n",
      "Her lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying.\r\n",
      "As she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater\r\n",
      "sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the\r\n",
      "more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character,\r\n",
      "with immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding my presence, she\r\n",
      "went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a\r\n",
      "sweet womanly caress.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYou have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you not,\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "having acted so harshly.â\r\n",

      "âWhy is he silent, then, if he is innocent?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWho knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect\r\n",
      "him.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHow could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with the\r\n",
      "coronet in his hand?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âOh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take my\r\n",
      "word for it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say no more.\r\n",
      "It is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in prison!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI shall never let it drop until the gems are foundânever, Mary! Your\r\n",
      "affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me. Far\r\n",
      "from hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman down from London\r\n",
      "to inquire more deeply into it.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThis gentleman?â she asked, facing round to me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNo, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in the\r\n",
      "stable lane now.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThe stable lane?â She raised her dark eyebrows. âWhat can he hope to\r\n",
      "find there? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir, that you will\r\n",
      "succeed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth, that my cousin\r\n",
      "Arthur is innocent of this crime.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may prove\r\n",

      "shoes. âI believe I have the honour of addressing Miss Mary Holder.\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his\r\n",
      "powerful magnifying lens. âNow we shall go upstairs,â said he at last.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The bankerâs dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber, with\r\n",
      "a grey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror. Holmes went to the\r\n",
      "bureau first and looked hard at the lock.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhich key was used to open it?â he asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThat which my son himself indicatedâthat of the cupboard of the\r\n",
      "lumber-room.â\r\n",

      "Sherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIt is a noiseless lock,â said he. âIt is no wonder that it did not\r\n",
      "wake you. This case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must have a\r\n",
      "look at it.â He opened the case, and taking out the diadem he laid it\r\n",
      "upon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the jewellerâs art,\r\n",
      "and the thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen. At one\r\n",
      "side of the coronet was a cracked edge, where a corner holding three\r\n",
      "gems had been torn away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNow, Mr. Holder,â said Holmes, âhere is the corner which corresponds\r\n",
      "to that which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I beg that you will\r\n",
      "break it off.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The banker recoiled in horror. âI should not dream of trying,â said he.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThen I will.â Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but without\r\n",
      "result. âI feel it give a little,â said he; âbut, though I am\r\n",
      "exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my time to\r\n",
      "break it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do you think would\r\n",
      "happen if I did break it, Mr. Holder? There would be a noise like a\r\n",
      "pistol shot. Do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards\r\n",
      "of your bed and that you heard nothing of it?â\r\n",

      "dimly imagine. Several times during our homeward journey I endeavoured\r\n",
      "to sound him upon the point, but he always glided away to some other\r\n",
      "topic, until at last I gave it over in despair. It was not yet three\r\n",
      "when we found ourselves in our rooms once more. He hurried to his\r\n",

      "With his collar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and\r\n",

      "fear that it wonât do. I may be on the trail in this matter, or I may\r\n",
      "be following a will-oâ-the-wisp, but I shall soon know which it is. I\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "I had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in excellent\r\n",

      "âHow are you getting on?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âOh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham since\r\n",

      "little problem, and I would not have missed it for a good deal.\r\n",

      "few minutes later I heard the slam of the hall door, which told me that\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "I waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so I\r\n",

      "days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that his\r\n",
      "lateness caused me no surprise. I do not know at what hour he came in,\r\n",
      "but when I came down to breakfast in the morning there he was with a\r\n",

      "âWhy, it is after nine now,â I answered. âI should not be surprised if\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "It was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the change\r\n",
      "which had come over him, for his face which was naturally of a broad\r\n",
      "and massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in, while his hair seemed\r\n",
      "to me at least a shade whiter. He entered with a weariness and lethargy\r\n",
      "which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before,\r\n",
      "and he dropped heavily into the armchair which I pushed forward for\r\n",
      "him.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âDeserted you?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was empty,\r\n",
      "and a note for me lay upon the hall table. I had said to her last\r\n",
      "night, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had married my boy all\r\n",
      "might have been well with him. Perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say\r\n",

      "    forever. Do not worry about my future, for that is provided for;\r\n",

      "kindled at the news, and he bent her to his will. I have no doubt that\r\n",
      "she loved you, but there are women in whom the love of a lover\r\n",
      "extinguishes all other loves, and I think that she must have been one.\r\n",
      "She had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming\r\n",
      "downstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told you about\r\n",

      "all perfectly true.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYour boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you but he\r\n",
      "slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts. In the\r\n",
      "middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door, so he rose\r\n",
      "and, looking out, was surprised to see his cousin walking very\r\n",
      "stealthily along the passage until she disappeared into your\r\n",
      "dressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad slipped on some\r\n",
      "clothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this\r\n",
      "strange affair. Presently she emerged from the room again, and in the\r\n",
      "light of the passage-lamp your son saw that she carried the precious\r\n",
      "coronet in her hands. She passed down the stairs, and he, thrilling\r\n",
      "with horror, ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door,\r\n",
      "whence he could see what passed in the hall beneath. He saw her\r\n",
      "stealthily open the window, hand out the coronet to someone in the\r\n",
      "gloom, and then closing it once more hurry back to her room, passing\r\n",
      "quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAs long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a\r\n",
      "horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. But the instant that she\r\n",
      "was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you,\r\n",
      "and how all-important it was to set it right. He rushed down, just as\r\n",
      "he was, in his bare feet, opened the window, sprang out into the snow,\r\n",
      "and ran down the lane, where he could see a dark figure in the\r\n",
      "moonlight. Sir George Burnwell tried to get away, but Arthur caught\r\n",
      "him, and there was a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one\r\n",
      "side of the coronet, and his opponent at the other. In the scuffle,\r\n",
      "your son struck Sir George and cut him over the eye. Then something\r\n",
      "suddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet in his\r\n",
      "hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your room, and had\r\n",
      "just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was\r\n",
      "endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIs it possible?â gasped the banker.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYou then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he\r\n",
      "felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not explain the\r\n",
      "true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved\r\n",
      "little enough consideration at his hands. He took the more chivalrous\r\n",
      "view, however, and preserved her secret.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAnd that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet,â\r\n",
      "cried Mr. Holder. âOh, my God! what a blind fool I have been! And his\r\n",
      "asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes! The dear fellow wanted\r\n",
      "to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle. How\r\n",
      "cruelly I have misjudged him!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhen I arrived at the house,â continued Holmes, âI at once went very\r\n",
      "carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow\r\n",
      "which might help me. I knew that none had fallen since the evening\r\n",
      "before, and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve\r\n",
      "impressions. I passed along the tradesmenâs path, but found it all\r\n",
      "trampled down and indistinguishable. Just beyond it, however, at the\r\n",
      "far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked with a man,\r\n",
      "whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg. I\r\n",
      "could even tell that they had been disturbed, for the woman had run\r\n",
      "back swiftly to the door, as was shown by the deep toe and light heel\r\n",
      "marks, while Wooden-leg had waited a little, and then had gone away. I\r\n",
      "thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of\r\n",
      "whom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so. I\r\n",
      "passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random\r\n",
      "tracks, which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable\r\n",
      "lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of\r\n",

      "and the dock. But look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields,\r\n",
      "filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the\r\n",
      "law. Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which\r\n",

      "on the fourth a field which slopes down to the Southampton highroad,\r\n",
      "which curves past about a hundred yards from the front door. This\r\n",
      "ground in front belongs to the house, but the woods all round are part\r\n",

      "creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement, and\r\n",

      "âI am glad of all details,â remarked my friend, âwhether they seem to\r\n",
      "you to be relevant or not.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI shall try not to miss anything of importance. The one unpleasant\r\n",
      "thing about the house, which struck me at once, was the appearance and\r\n",
      "conduct of the servants. There are only two, a man and his wife.\r\n",
      "Toller, for that is his name, is a rough, uncouth man, with grizzled\r\n",
      "hair and whiskers, and a perpetual smell of drink. Twice since I have\r\n",
      "been with them he has been quite drunk, and yet Mr. Rucastle seemed to\r\n",
      "take no notice of it. His wife is a very tall and strong woman with a\r\n",
      "sour face, as silent as Mrs. Rucastle and much less amiable. They are a\r\n",
      "most unpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in the\r\n",
      "nursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one corner of\r\n",
      "the building.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âFor two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was very\r\n",
      "quiet; on the third, Mrs. Rucastle came down just after breakfast and\r\n",
      "whispered something to her husband.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "ââOh, yes,â said he, turning to me, âwe are very much obliged to you,\r\n",
      "Miss Hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair.\r\n",
      "I assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your\r\n",
      "appearance. We shall now see how the electric-blue dress will become\r\n",
      "you. You will find it laid out upon the bed in your room, and if you\r\n",
      "would be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThe dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of\r\n",
      "blue. It was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it bore\r\n",
      "unmistakable signs of having been worn before. It could not have been a\r\n",
      "better fit if I had been measured for it. Both Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle\r\n",
      "expressed a delight at the look of it, which seemed quite exaggerated\r\n",
      "in its vehemence. They were waiting for me in the drawing-room, which\r\n",
      "is a very large room, stretching along the entire front of the house,\r\n",
      "with three long windows reaching down to the floor. A chair had been\r\n",
      "placed close to the central window, with its back turned towards it. In\r\n",
      "this I was asked to sit, and then Mr. Rucastle, walking up and down on\r\n",
      "the other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest\r\n",
      "stories that I have ever listened to. You cannot imagine how comical he\r\n",
      "was, and I laughed until I was quite weary. Mrs. Rucastle, however, who\r\n",
      "has evidently no sense of humour, never so much as smiled, but sat with\r\n",
      "her hands in her lap, and a sad, anxious look upon her face. After an\r\n",
      "hour or so, Mr. Rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence\r\n",
      "the duties of the day, and that I might change my dress and go to\r\n",
      "little Edward in the nursery.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âTwo days later this same performance was gone through under exactly\r\n",
      "similar circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I sat in the\r\n",
      "window, and again I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which\r\n",
      "my employer had an immense _rÃ©pertoire_, and which he told inimitably.\r\n",
      "Then he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and moving my chair a little\r\n",
      "sideways, that my own shadow might not fall upon the page, he begged me\r\n",
      "to read aloud to him. I read for about ten minutes, beginning in the\r\n",
      "heart of a chapter, and then suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he\r\n",
      "ordered me to cease and to change my dress.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYou can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I became as to what\r\n",
      "the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be. They\r\n",
      "were always very careful, I observed, to turn my face away from the\r\n",
      "window, so that I became consumed with the desire to see what was going\r\n",
      "on behind my back. At first it seemed to be impossible, but I soon\r\n",
      "devised a means. My hand-mirror had been broken, so a happy thought\r\n",
      "seized me, and I concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief. On\r\n",
      "the next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, I put my handkerchief\r\n",
      "up to my eyes, and was able with a little management to see all that\r\n",
      "there was behind me. I confess that I was disappointed. There was\r\n",
      "nothing. At least that was my first impression. At the second glance,\r\n",
      "however, I perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton\r\n",
      "Road, a small bearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in\r\n",
      "my direction. The road is an important highway, and there are usually\r\n",
      "people there. This man, however, was leaning against the railings which\r\n",
      "bordered our field and was looking earnestly up. I lowered my\r\n",
      "handkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon\r\n",
      "me with a most searching gaze. She said nothing, but I am convinced\r\n",
      "that she had divined that I had a mirror in my hand and had seen what\r\n",
      "was behind me. She rose at once.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "ââJephro,â said she, âthere is an impertinent fellow upon the road\r\n",
      "there who stares up at Miss Hunter.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "ââNo friend of yours, Miss Hunter?â he asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "ââNo, I know no one in these parts.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "ââDear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion to him to\r\n",
      "go away.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "ââSurely it would be better to take no notice.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "ââNo, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly turn round\r\n",
      "and wave him away like that.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew down\r\n",
      "the blind. That was a week ago, and from that time I have not sat again\r\n",
      "in the window, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor seen the man in the\r\n",
      "road.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âPray continue,â said Holmes. âYour narrative promises to be a most\r\n",
      "interesting one.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYou will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may prove to\r\n",
      "be little relation between the different incidents of which I speak. On\r\n",
      "the very first day that I was at the Copper Beeches, Mr. Rucastle took\r\n",
      "me to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door. As we\r\n",
      "approached it I heard the sharp rattling of a chain, and the sound as\r\n",
      "of a large animal moving about.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "ââLook in here!â said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slit between two\r\n",
      "planks. âIs he not a beauty?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a vague\r\n",
      "figure huddled up in the darkness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "ââDonât be frightened,â said my employer, laughing at the start which I\r\n",
      "had given. âItâs only Carlo, my mastiff. I call him mine, but really\r\n",
      "old Toller, my groom, is the only man who can do anything with him. We\r\n",
      "feed him once a day, and not too much then, so that he is always as\r\n",
      "keen as mustard. Toller lets him loose every night, and God help the\r\n",
      "trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon. For goodnessâ sake donât you\r\n",
      "ever on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night, for itâs\r\n",
      "as much as your life is worth.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThe warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to look\r\n",
      "out of my bedroom window about two oâclock in the morning. It was a\r\n",
      "beautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was\r\n",
      "silvered over and almost as bright as day. I was standing, rapt in the\r\n",
      "peaceful beauty of the scene, when I was aware that something was\r\n",
      "moving under the shadow of the copper beeches. As it emerged into the\r\n",
      "moonshine I saw what it was. It was a giant dog, as large as a calf,\r\n",
      "tawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting\r\n",
      "bones. It walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow\r\n",
      "upon the other side. That dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart\r\n",
      "which I do not think that any burglar could have done.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAnd now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as you\r\n",
      "know, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a great coil at\r\n",
      "the bottom of my trunk. One evening, after the child was in bed, I\r\n",
      "began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by\r\n",
      "rearranging my own little things. There was an old chest of drawers in\r\n",
      "the room, the two upper ones empty and open, the lower one locked. I\r\n",
      "had filled the first two with my linen, and as I had still much to pack\r\n",
      "away I was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer.\r\n",
      "It struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight, so I\r\n",
      "took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The very first key\r\n",
      "fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There was only one\r\n",
      "thing in it, but I am sure that you would never guess what it was. It\r\n",
      "was my coil of hair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint, and\r\n",
      "the same thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing obtruded\r\n",
      "itself upon me. How could my hair have been locked in the drawer? With\r\n",
      "trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the contents, and drew\r\n",
      "from the bottom my own hair. I laid the two tresses together, and I\r\n",
      "assure you that they were identical. Was it not extraordinary? Puzzle\r\n",
      "as I would, I could make nothing at all of what it meant. I returned\r\n",
      "the strange hair to the drawer, and I said nothing of the matter to the\r\n",
      "Rucastles as I felt that I had put myself in the wrong by opening a\r\n",
      "drawer which they had locked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes, and I\r\n",
      "soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head. There was\r\n",
      "one wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited at all. A door\r\n",
      "which faced that which led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into\r\n",
      "this suite, but it was invariably locked. One day, however, as I\r\n",
      "ascended the stair, I met Mr. Rucastle coming out through this door,\r\n",
      "his keys in his hand, and a look on his face which made him a very\r\n",
      "different person to the round, jovial man to whom I was accustomed. His\r\n",
      "cheeks were red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins\r\n",
      "stood out at his temples with passion. He locked the door and hurried\r\n",
      "past me without a word or a look.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThis aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the\r\n",
      "grounds with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I could\r\n",
      "see the windows of this part of the house. There were four of them in a\r\n",
      "row, three of which were simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered\r\n",
      "up. They were evidently all deserted. As I strolled up and down,\r\n",
      "glancing at them occasionally, Mr. Rucastle came out to me, looking as\r\n",
      "merry and jovial as ever.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "ââAh!â said he, âyou must not think me rude if I passed you without a\r\n",
      "word, my dear young lady. I was preoccupied with business matters.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI assured him that I was not offended. âBy the way,â said I, âyou seem\r\n",
      "to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one of them has the\r\n",
      "shutters up.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHe looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled at my\r\n",
      "remark.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "ââPhotography is one of my hobbies,â said he. âI have made my dark room\r\n",
      "up there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady we have come upon.\r\n",
      "Who would have believed it? Who would have ever believed it?â He spoke\r\n",
      "in a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at\r\n",
      "me. I read suspicion there and annoyance, but no jest.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWell, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there was\r\n",
      "something about that suite of rooms which I was not to know, I was all\r\n",
      "on fire to go over them. It was not mere curiosity, though I have my\r\n",
      "share of that. It was more a feeling of dutyâa feeling that some good\r\n",
      "might come from my penetrating to this place. They talk of womanâs\r\n",
      "instinct; perhaps it was womanâs instinct which gave me that feeling.\r\n",
      "At any rate, it was there, and I was keenly on the lookout for any\r\n",
      "chance to pass the forbidden door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIt was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that,\r\n",
      "besides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to do in\r\n",
      "these deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen\r\n",
      "bag with him through the door. Recently he has been drinking hard, and\r\n",
      "yesterday evening he was very drunk; and when I came upstairs there was\r\n",
      "the key in the door. I have no doubt at all that he had left it there.\r\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both downstairs, and the child was with\r\n",
      "them, so that I had an admirable opportunity. I turned the key gently\r\n",
      "in the lock, opened the door, and slipped through.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThere was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted,\r\n",
      "which turned at a right angle at the farther end. Round this corner\r\n",
      "were three doors in a line, the first and third of which were open.\r\n",
      "They each led into an empty room, dusty and cheerless, with two windows\r\n",
      "in the one and one in the other, so thick with dirt that the evening\r\n",
      "light glimmered dimly through them. The centre door was closed, and\r\n",
      "across the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an\r\n",
      "iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened at\r\n",
      "the other with stout cord. The door itself was locked as well, and the\r\n",
      "key was not there. This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the\r\n",
      "shuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from\r\n",
      "beneath it that the room was not in darkness. Evidently there was a\r\n",
      "skylight which let in light from above. As I stood in the passage\r\n",
      "gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it might veil, I\r\n",
      "suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow pass\r\n",
      "backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone\r\n",
      "out from under the door. A mad, unreasoning terror rose up in me at the\r\n",
      "sight, Mr. Holmes. My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and I\r\n",
      "turned and ranâran as though some dreadful hand were behind me\r\n",
      "clutching at the skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through\r\n",
      "the door, and straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting\r\n",
      "outside.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "ââSo,â said he, smiling, âit was you, then. I thought that it must be\r\n",
      "when I saw the door open.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "ââOh, I am so frightened!â I panted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "ââMy dear young lady! my dear young lady!ââyou cannot think how\r\n",
      "caressing and soothing his manner wasââand what has frightened you, my\r\n",
      "dear young lady?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âBut his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I was\r\n",
      "keenly on my guard against him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "ââI was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,â I answered. âBut it\r\n",
      "is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was frightened and ran\r\n",
      "out again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in there!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "ââOnly that?â said he, looking at me keenly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "ââWhy, what did you think?â I asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "ââWhy do you think that I lock this door?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "ââI am sure that I do not know.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "ââIt is to keep people out who have no business there. Do you see?â He\r\n",
      "was still smiling in the most amiable manner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "ââI am sure if I had knownââ\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "ââWell, then, you know now. And if you ever put your foot over that\r\n",
      "threshold againââhere in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of\r\n",
      "rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a demonââIâll throw you\r\n",
      "to the mastiff.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that I\r\n",
      "must have rushed past him into my room. I remember nothing until I\r\n",
      "found myself lying on my bed trembling all over. Then I thought of you,\r\n",
      "Mr. Holmes. I could not live there longer without some advice. I was\r\n",
      "frightened of the house, of the man, of the woman, of the servants,\r\n",
      "even of the child. They were all horrible to me. If I could only bring\r\n",
      "you down all would be well. Of course I might have fled from the house,\r\n",
      "but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears. My mind was soon\r\n",
      "made up. I would send you a wire. I put on my hat and cloak, went down\r\n",
      "to the office, which is about half a mile from the house, and then\r\n",
      "returned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my mind\r\n",
      "as I approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I remembered\r\n",
      "that Toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that\r\n",
      "evening, and I knew that he was the only one in the household who had\r\n",
      "any influence with the savage creature, or who would venture to set him\r\n",
      "free. I slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at\r\n",
      "the thought of seeing you. I had no difficulty in getting leave to come\r\n",
      "into Winchester this morning, but I must be back before three oâclock,\r\n",
      "for Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all\r\n",
      "the evening, so that I must look after the child. Now I have told you\r\n",
      "all my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad if you could\r\n",
      "tell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should do.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Holmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story. My\r\n",
      "friend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in his\r\n",
      "pockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIs Toller still drunk?â he asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do nothing\r\n",
      "with him.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThat is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?â\r\n",

      "much labour we separated them and carried him, living but horribly\r\n",
      "mangled, into the house. We laid him upon the drawing-room sofa, and\r\n",
      "having dispatched the sobered Toller to bear the news to his wife, I\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "âI will soon make it clear to you,â said she; âand Iâd have done so\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âShe was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasnât, from the time that her\r\n",
      "father married again. She was slighted like and had no say in anything,\r\n",
      "but it never really became bad for her until after she met Mr. Fowler\r\n",
      "at a friendâs house. As well as I could learn, Miss Alice had rights of\r\n",
      "her own by will, but she was so quiet and patient, she was, that she\r\n",
      "never said a word about them but just left everything in Mr. Rucastleâs\r\n",
      "hands. He knew he was safe with her; but when there was a chance of a\r\n",
      "husband coming forward, who would ask for all that the law would give\r\n",
      "him, then her father thought it time to put a stop on it. He wanted her\r\n",
      "to sign a paper, so that whether she married or not, he could use her\r\n",
      "money. When she wouldnât do it, he kept on worrying her until she got\r\n",
      "brain-fever, and for six weeks was at deathâs door. Then she got better\r\n",
      "at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her beautiful hair cut off; but\r\n",
      "that didnât make no change in her young man, and he stuck to her as\r\n",
      "true as man could be.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAh,â said Holmes, âI think that what you have been good enough to tell\r\n",
      "us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce all that\r\n",
      "remains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this system of\r\n",
      "imprisonment?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes, sir.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "âThat was it, sir.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âBut Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should be,\r\n",
      "blockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain arguments,\r\n",
      "metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests were the\r\n",
      "same as his.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "had gone out.â\r\n",
