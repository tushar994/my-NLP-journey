    "So far, in lexical processing, we have treated our text as a set of words. We disregarded the order of the words, removed stop words, converted words to their root form, and treated the set of occurances of a word as if each occurance has the same meaning. This is very shortsighted, and when we do this, we can lose alot of information, in terms of the meaning of the text.\n",
